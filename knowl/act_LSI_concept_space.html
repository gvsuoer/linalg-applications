<div class="introduction"><p>For an original query <span class="process-math">\(\vq\text{,}\)</span> we start with its term vector <span class="process-math">\(\va_{\vq}\)</span> (a vector in the coordinate system determined by the columns of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span>) and find a representation <span class="process-math">\(\vv_{\vq}\)</span> that we can use as a column of <span class="process-math">\(V^{\tr}\)</span> in the document-document comparison matrix. If this representation was perfect, then it would take a real document in the original system given by <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and produce the corresponding column of <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> if we used the full SVD. In other words, we would have <span class="process-math">\(\va_{\vq} = U \Sigma \vv_{\vq}^{\tr}\text{.}\)</span></p></div>
<article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h5>
<p>Use the fact that <span class="process-math">\(A_k = U_k \Sigma_k V_k^{\tr}\text{,}\)</span> to show that <span class="process-math">\(V_k = A_k^{\tr} U_k \Sigma_k^{-1}\text{.}\)</span> It follows that <span class="process-math">\(\vq\)</span> is transformed into the query <span class="process-math">\(\vq_k = \vq^{\tr}U_k \Sigma_k^{-1}\text{.}\)</span></p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>
<p>In our example, using <span class="process-math">\(k=2\text{,}\)</span> the terms can now be represented as <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span>-dimensional vectors (the rows of <span class="process-math">\(U_2\text{,}\)</span> see <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-term-reduced.html" title="Figure 29.12">Figure 29.12</a>), or as points in the plane. More specifically, <em class="emphasis">human</em> is represented by the vector (to two decimal places) <span class="process-math">\([-0.22 \ -0.11]^{\tr}\text{,}\)</span> <em class="emphasis">interface</em> by <span class="process-math">\([- 0.20 \ - 0.07]^{\tr}\text{,}\)</span> etc. Similarly, the documents are represented by columns of <span class="process-math">\(V_2\)</span> (see <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-doc-reduced.html" title="Figure 29.13">Figure 29.13</a>), so that the document <span class="process-math">\(c_1\)</span> is represented by <span class="process-math">\([-0.20 \ -0.06]^{\tr}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(c_2\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\([-0.61 \ 0.17]^{\tr}\text{,}\)</span> etc. From this perspective we can visualize these documents in the plane. Plot the documents and the query in the 2-dimensional concept space. Then calculate the cosine distances from the query to the documents in this space. Which documents now give the best three matches to the query? Compare the matches to your plot.</p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="chap_SVD.html#act_LSI_concept_space" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
