<div class="introduction">
<p>Consider a very simplified weather forecast. Let us assume there are two possible states for the weather: rainy (<span class="process-math">\(R\)</span>) or sunny(<span class="process-math">\(S\)</span>). Let us also assume that the weather patterns are stable enough that we can reasonably predict the weather tomorrow based on the weather today. If is is sunny today, then there is a 70% chance that it will be sunny tomorrow, and if it is rainy today then there is a 40% chance that it will be rainy tomorrow. If <span class="process-math">\(\vx_0 = \left[ \begin{array}{c} s \\ r \end{array}  \right]\)</span> is a state vector that indicates a probability <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> that it is sunny and probability <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> that it is rainy on day <span class="process-math">\(0\text{,}\)</span> then</p>

\begin{equation*}

<p>The previous result demonstrates that to determine the long-term probability of a sunny or rainy day, we want to be able to easily calculate powers of the matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> Use a computer algebra system (e.g., Maple, Mathematica, Wolfram<span class="process-math">\(|\)</span>Alpha) to calculate the entries of <span class="process-math">\(\vx_{10}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vx_{20}\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vx_{30}\text{.}\)</span> Based on this data, what do you expect the long term probability of any day being a sunny one?</p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="chap_diagonalization.html#pa_4_c" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
