<p> For example, <span class="process-math">\(x_1=2, x_2=1\text{,}\)</span> or simply <span class="process-math">\((2,1)\text{,}\)</span> is a solution to the above system of linear equations in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_1_a_PA_1.html" title="Equation 1.5">(1.5)</a> as can be checked by substituting the variables into each equation. In solving a system of linear equations, we are interested in finding the set of all solutions, which we will call the <dfn class="terminology">solution set of the system</dfn>. For the above system in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_1_a_PA_1.html" title="Equation 1.5">(1.5)</a>, the solution set is the set containing the single point <span class="process-math">\((2,1)\text{,}\)</span> denoted <span class="process-math">\(\{(2,1)\}\text{,}\)</span> because there is only one solution. If we consider just the equation <span class="process-math">\(x_1-x_2=0\)</span> as our system, the solution set is the line <span class="process-math">\(x_1=x_2\)</span> in the plane. More generally, a set of solutions is a collection of ordered <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-tuples of numbers. We denote the set of all ordered <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-tuples of numbers as <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{.}\)</span> So, for example, <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> is the set of all ordered pairs, or just the standard coordinate plane, and <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\)</span> is the set of all ordered triples, or the three-dimensional space.</p>
