<p><a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act_5_a_2.html" title="Activity 31.3">Activity 31.3</a> illustrates an important point. There is a fundamental difference in the types of properties that define a vector space. Some of the properties that define a vector space are true for any subset of the vector space because they are properties of the operations (such as the commutative and associative properties). The other properties (closure, the inclusion of the zero vector, and the inclusion of additive inverses) are set properties, not properties of the operations. So these three properties have to be specifically checked to see if a subset of a vector space is also a vector space. This leads to the definition of a <dfn class="terminology">subspace</dfn>, a subset of a vector space which is a vector space itself.</p>
