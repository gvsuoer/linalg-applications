<p>Before we introduce the Singular Value Decomposition, let us work through some preliminaries to motivate the idea. The first is to provide an answer to the question “How ‘big’ is a matrix?” There are many ways to interpret and answer this question, but a substantial (and useful) answer should involve more than just the dimensions of the matrix. A good measure of the size of a matrix, which we will refer to as the norm of the matrix, should take into account the action of the linear transformation defined by the matrix on vectors. This then will lead to questions about how difficult or easy is it to solve a matrix equation <span class="process-math">\(A \vx = \vb\text{.}\)</span></p>
