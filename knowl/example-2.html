<p>A mining company has three mines. One day of operation at the mines produces the following output.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Mine 1 produces 25 tons of copper, 600 kilograms of silver and 15 tons of manganese.</p></li>
<li><p>Mine 2 produces 30 tons of copper, 500 kilograms of silver and 10 tons of manganese.</p></li>
<li><p>Mine 3 produces 20 tons of copper, 550 kilograms of silver and 12 tons of manganese.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Suppose the company has orders for 550 tons of copper, 11350 kilograms of silver and 250 tons of manganese.</p>
<p>Write a system of equations to answer the question: how many days should the company operate each mine to exactly fill the orders? State clearly what the variables in your system represent. Then find the general solution of your system.</p>
<div class="solution solution-like">
<h4 class="heading">
<span class="type">Solution</span><span class="period">.</span>
</h4>
<p>For our system, let <span class="process-math">\(x_1\)</span> be the number of days mine 1 operates, <span class="process-math">\(x_2\)</span> be the number of days mine 2 operates, and <span class="process-math">\(x_3\)</span> be the number of days mine 3 operates. Since mine 1 produces 25 tons of copper each day, in <span class="process-math">\(x_1\)</span> days mine 1 will produce <span class="process-math">\(25x_1\)</span> tons of copper. Mine 2 produces 30 tons of copper each day, so in <span class="process-math">\(x_2\)</span> days mine 2 will produce <span class="process-math">\(30x_2\)</span> tons of copper. Also, mine 3 produces 20 tons of copper each day, so in <span class="process-math">\(x_3\)</span> days mine 3 will produce <span class="process-math">\(20x_3\)</span> tons of copper. Since the company needs to supply a total of 550 tons of copper, we need to have <span class="process-math">\(25x_1+30x_2+20x_3 = 550\text{.}\)</span> Similar analyses of silver and manganese give us the system</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{alignat*}{4}
{25}x_1    \amp {}+{}  \amp {30}x_2  \amp {}+{}   \amp {20}x_3  \amp {}={}   \amp 550\amp {}\\
{600}x_1    \amp {}+{}  \amp {500}x_2  \amp {}+{}  \amp {550}x_3   \amp {}={}   \amp 11350\amp {}\\

\end{alignat*}
</div>
<p>To solve the system, we eliminate the variable <span class="process-math">\(x_2\)</span> from the second and third equations by replacing equation two with equation two minus 24 times equation one and replacing equation three with equation three minus <span class="process-math">\(\frac{3}{5}\)</span> times equation one. This produces the equvalent system</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{alignat*}{4}
{25}x_1    \amp {}+{}  \amp {30}x_2  \amp {}+{}   \amp {20}x_3  \amp {}={}   \amp {}550\amp {}\\
{}      \amp {}-{}    \amp {220}x_2  \amp {}+{}    \amp {70}x_3   \amp {}={}   \amp {-}1850\amp {}\\
{}        \amp {}-{}  \amp {8}x_2    \amp {}{}    \amp {}       \amp {}={}  \amp {-}80\amp {.}
\end{alignat*}
</div>
<p>We are fortunate now that we can determine the value of <span class="process-math">\(x_2\)</span> from the third equation, which tells us that <span class="process-math">\(x_2 = 10\text{.}\)</span> Substituting into the second equation shows that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{alignat*}{1}
-220(10) + 70x_3 \amp = -1850\\
70x_3 \amp = 350\\
x_3 \amp = 5\text{.}
\end{alignat*}
</div>
<p>Substituting into the first equation allows us to determine the value for <span class="process-math">\(x_1\text{:}\)</span></p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{alignat*}{1}
25x_1 + 30(10) + 20(5) \amp = 550\\
25x_1 \amp = 150\\
x_1 \amp = 6\text{.}
\end{alignat*}
</div>
<p>So the company should run mine 1 for 6 days, mine 2 for 10 days, and mine 3 for 5 days to meet this demand.</p>
