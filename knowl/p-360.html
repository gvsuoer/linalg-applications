<p>We approximate <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> on each subinterval using a quadratic. So we need to find the quadratic <span class="process-math">\(Q(x) = c_2x^2+c_1x+c_0\)</span> that passes through two consecutive end points as well as the midpoint of a subinterval. That is, we need to find the coefficients of <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> passes through the points <span class="process-math">\((x_k,y_k)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\((x_{k+2}, y_{k+2})\text{,}\)</span> and the midpoint <span class="process-math">\((x_{k+1},y_{k+1})\)</span> on the interval <span class="process-math">\([x_k, x_{k+2}]\)</span> (so that we have three points to which to fit a parabola) as shown at left in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_1_b_quad_fit.html" title="Figure 2.13">Figure 2.13</a>. Note that the length of the interval <span class="process-math">\([x_k, x_{k+2}]\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(2\Delta x\text{.}\)</span> To make the calculations easier, we will translate our function so that our leftmost point is <span class="process-math">\((-r, y_k)\text{.}\)</span> Then the middle point is <span class="process-math">\((0, y_{k+1})\)</span> and the rightmost point is <span class="process-math">\((r, y_{k+2})\)</span> as illustrated at right in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_1_b_quad_fit.html" title="Figure 2.13">Figure 2.13</a>, where <span class="process-math">\(r = \Delta x\text{.}\)</span></p>
