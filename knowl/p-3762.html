<p>We have stated that the determinant of a matrix can be calculated by using a cofactor expansion along any row or column. We use the result that swapping rows introduces a factor of <span class="process-math">\(-1\)</span> in the determinant to verify that result in this section. Note that in proving that <span class="process-math">\(\det(A^{\tr}) = \det(A)\text{,}\)</span> we have already shown that the cofactor expansion along the first column is the same as the cofactor expansion along the first row. If we can prove that the cofactor expansion along any row is the same, then the fact that <span class="process-math">\(\det(A^{\tr}) = \det(A)\)</span> will imply that the cofactor expansion along any column is the same as well.</p>
