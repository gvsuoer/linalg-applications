<p>In video games, the speed at which a computer can render changing graphics views is vitally important. To increase a computer's ability to render a scene, programs often try to identify those parts of the images a viewer could see and those parts the viewer could not see. For example, in a scene involving buildings, the viewer could not see any images blocked by a solid building. In the mathematical world, this can be visualized by graphing surfaces. In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_House.html" title="Figure 23.1">Figure 23.1</a> we see a crude image of a house made up of small polygons (this is how programs generally represent surfaces). On the left in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_House.html" title="Figure 23.1">Figure 23.1</a> we see all of the polygons that are needed to construct the entire surface, even those polygons that lie behind others which we could not see if the surface was solid. On the right in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_House.html" title="Figure 23.1">Figure 23.1</a> we have hidden the parts of the polygons that we cannot see from our view.</p>
