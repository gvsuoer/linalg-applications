<p>As we saw before, the systems with all the right hand side constants being 0 are special in that they always have a solution. (Why?) So we might consider grouping systems into two types: Those of the form <span class="process-math">\(A \vx = \vb\text{,}\)</span> where not all of the entries of the vector <span class="process-math">\(\vb\)</span> are <span class="process-math">\(0\text{,}\)</span> and those of the form <span class="process-math">\(A \vx = \vzero\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(\vzero\)</span> is the vector of all zeros. Systems like <span class="process-math">\(A \vx = \vb\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(\vb\)</span> contains at least one non-zero entry, are called <dfn class="terminology">nonhomogeneous</dfn> systems, and systems of the form <span class="process-math">\(A \vx = \vzero\)</span> are called <dfn class="terminology">homogeneous</dfn> systems. For every nonhomogeneous system <span class="process-math">\(A \vx = \vb\)</span> there is a corresponding homogeneous system <span class="process-math">\(A \vx = \vzero\text{.}\)</span> We now investigate the connection between the solutions to the nonhomogeneous system and the corresponding homogeneous system.</p>
