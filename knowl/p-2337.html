<p>We will take the latter perspective and view the Lights Out game as if it is played on a <span class="process-math">\(25 \times 1\)</span> board with entries in <span class="process-math">\(\Z_2\text{.}\)</span> The space of all of these Lights Out configurations is denoted as <span class="process-math">\(\Z_2^{25}\)</span> (similar to <span class="process-math">\(\R^{25}\text{,}\)</span> but with entries in <span class="process-math">\(\Z_2\)</span> rather than <span class="process-math">\(\R\)</span>). Since <span class="process-math">\(\Z_2\)</span> is a field, the space <span class="process-math">\(\Z_2^{25}\)</span> is a vector space just as <span class="process-math">\(\R^{25}\)</span> is. This is the environment in which we will play the Lights Out game.</p>
