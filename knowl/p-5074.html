<p>Though we were able to rate the documents in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act_LSI_standard.html" title="Project Activity 29.5">Project Activity 29.5</a> using the cosine distance, the result is less than satisfying. Documents <span class="process-math">\(c_3\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(c_4\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c_5\)</span> are all related to computers but do not appear at all in or results. This is a problem with language searches — we don't want to compare just words, but we also need to compare the concepts the words represent. The fact that words can represent different things implies that a random choice of word by different authors can introduce noise into the word-concept relationship. To filter out this noise, we can apply the singular value decomposition to find a smaller set of concepts to better represent the relationships. Before we do so, we examine some useful properties of the term-document matrix.</p>
