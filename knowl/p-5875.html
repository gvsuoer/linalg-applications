<p>An ideal view of our data would be one in which we can see the direction of greatest variance and one that minimizes redundancy. With redundant data the variables are not independent — that is, covariance is nonzero. So we would like the covariances to all be zero (or as close to zero as possible) to remove redundancy in our data. That means that we would like a covariance matrix in which the non-diagonal entries are all zero. This will be possible if the covariance matrix is diagonalizable.</p>
