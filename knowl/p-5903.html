<p>So each <span class="process-math">\(y_i\)</span> is a linear combination of the original variables (contained in the <span class="process-math">\(\vc_i\)</span>) with weights from the first principal component. The other new variables are obtained in the same way from the remaining principal components. So even though the principal components may not have an easy interpretation in context, they are connected to the original data in this way. By reducing the data to a few important principal components — that is, visualizing the data in a subspace of small dimension — we can account for almost all of the variation in the data and relate that information back to the original data.</p>
