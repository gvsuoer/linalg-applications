<p>There is some important terminology related to matrices.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Any number in a matrix is called an <dfn class="terminology">entry</dfn> of the matrix.</p></li>
<li><p>The collection of entries in an augmented matrix that corresponds to a given equation (that is reading the entries from left to right, or a horizontal set of entries) is called a <dfn class="terminology">row</dfn> of the matrix. We number the rows from top to bottom in a matrix. For example, <span class="process-math">\(\left[ \begin{array}{crc} 1\amp -1\amp 1 \end{array} \right]\)</span> is the first row and <span class="process-math">\(\left[ \begin{array}{ccc} 1\amp 1\amp 1 \end{array} \right]\)</span> is the second row of the coefficient matrix of the system <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_PA_1.html" title="Equation 2.1">(2.1)</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The set of entries as we read from top to bottom (or a vertical set of entries that correspond to one fixed variable or the constants on the right hand sides of the equations) is called a <dfn class="terminology">column</dfn> of the matrix. We number the columns from left to right in a matrix. For example, <span class="process-math">\(\left[ \begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 1 \\ 4 \end{array} \right]\)</span> is the first column and <span class="process-math">\(\left[ \begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{array} \right]\)</span> is the third column of the coefficient matrix of the system <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_PA_1.html" title="Equation 2.1">(2.1)</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The <dfn class="terminology">size</dfn> of a matrix is given as <span class="process-math">\(m\times n\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> is the number of rows and <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is the number of columns. The coefficient matrix above is a <span class="process-math">\(3\times 3\)</span> matrix since it has 3 rows and 3 columns, while the augmented matrix is a <span class="process-math">\(3\times 4\)</span> matrix as it has 4 columns.</p></li>
