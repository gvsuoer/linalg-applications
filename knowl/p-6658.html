<p>Suppose we have a secret that we want or need to share with several individuals. For example, a bank manager might want to share pieces of the code for the bank vault with several employees so that if the manager is not available, some subset of these employees could open the vault if they work together. This allows for a significant amount of security while still making the code available if needed. As another example, in order to keep passwords secure (as they can be hard to remember), a person could implement a secret sharing scheme. The person would generate a set of shares for a given password and store them in several different places. If the person forgets the password, it can be reconstructed by collecting some set of these shares. Since the shares can be stored in many different places, the password is relatively secure.</p>
