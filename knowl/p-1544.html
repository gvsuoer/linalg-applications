<p>The World Wide Web is a vast collection of information, searchable via search engines. A search engine looks for pages that are of interest to the user. In order to be effective, a search engine needs to be able to identify those pages that are relevant to the search criteria provided by the user. This involves determining the relative importance of different web pages by ranking the results of thousands or millions of pages fitting the search criteria. For Google, the PageRank algorithm is their method and is “the heart of our software” as they say. It is this PageRank algorithm that we will learn about later in this section. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors play an important role in this algorithm.</p>
