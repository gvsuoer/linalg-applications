<p>The solution to the Hooke's Law differential equation in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act_de_Hooke.html" title="Project Activity 39.6">Project Activity 39.6</a> indicates that the spring will continue to oscillate forever. In reality, we know that this does not happen. In the non-ideal case, there is always some force (e.g., friction, air resistance, a physical damper as in a piston) that acts to dampen the motion of the spring causing the oscillations to die off. Damping acts to oppose the motion, and we generally assume that the faster an object moves, the higher the damping. For this reason we assume the damping force is proportional to the velocity. That is, the damping force has the form <span class="process-math">\(-by'\)</span> for some positive constant <span class="process-math">\(b\text{.}\)</span> This produces the differential equation</p>

<p>Since derivatives of exponential functions are still exponential functions, it seems reasonable to try an exponential function as a solution to <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act_de_second.html" title="Equation 39.5">(39.5)</a>.

<p>Part (a) shows that our solutions to the differential equation <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act_de_second.html" title="Equation 39.5">(39.5)</a> are exponential of the form <span class="process-math">\(e^{rt}\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> is a solution to the auxiliary equation. Recall that if we can find two linearly independent solutions to <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act_de_second.html" title="Equation 39.5">(39.5)</a>, then we have found a basis for the eigenspace <span class="process-math">\(E_{-k}\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(mD^2+bD\)</span> with eigenvalue <span class="process-math">\(-k\text{.}\)</span> The quadratic equation shows that the roots of the auxiliary equation are</p>

<p class="continuation">As we will see, our basis depends on the types of roots the auxiliary equation has.</p>

<p>Assume that the roots <span class="process-math">\(r_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(r_2\)</span> of the auxiliary equation are real and distinct. That means that <span class="process-math">\(y_1 = e^{r_1t}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y_2 = e^{r_2t}\)</span> are eigenfunctions in <span class="process-math">\(E_{-k}\text{.}\)</span> Use the Wronskian to show that <span class="process-math">\(\{y_1, y_2\}\)</span> is a basis for <span class="process-math">\(E_{-k}\)</span> in this case. Then describe the behavior of an arbitrary eigenfunction in <span class="process-math">\(E_{-2}\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(mD^2+bD = D^2+3D\)</span> and how it relates to damping. Draw a representative solution to illustrate. (In this case we say that the system is <dfn class="terminology">overdamped</dfn>. These systems can oscillate at most once, then they quickly damp to <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span>)</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(ii)</span></h6>
<p>Now suppose that we have a repeated real root <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> to the auxiliary equation. Then there is only one exponential function <span class="process-math">\(y_1 = e^{rt}\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(E_{-k}\text{.}\)</span> In this case, show that <span class="process-math">\(y_2 = te^{rt}\)</span> is also in <span class="process-math">\(E_{-k}\)</span> and that <span class="process-math">\(\{y_1, y_2\}\)</span> is a basis for <span class="process-math">\(E_{-k}\text{.}\)</span> Then describe the behavior of an arbitrary eigenfunction in <span class="process-math">\(E_{-1}\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(mD^2+bD = D^2+2D\)</span> and how it relates to damping. Draw a representative solution to illustrate. (In this case we say that the system is <dfn class="terminology">critically damped</dfn>. These systems behave similar to the overdamped systems in that they do not oscillations. However, if the damping is reduced just a little, the system can oscillate.)</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(iii)</span></h6>
<p>The last case is when the auxiliary equation has complex roots <span class="process-math">\(z_1 = u+vi\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(z_2 = u-vi\text{.}\)</span> We want to work with real valued functions, so we need to determine real valued solutions from these complex roots. To resolve this problem, we note that if <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is a real number, then <span class="process-math">\(e^{ix} = \cos(x) + i \sin(x)\text{.}\)</span> So</p>
