<p>We saw in the previous section that geometrically two parallel and distinct lines represent a linear system with two equations in two unknowns which has no solution. Similarly, two parallel and distinct planes in three dimensions represent a linear system with two equations in three unknowns which has no solution. We can have at least four different geometric configurations of three planes in three dimensions representing a system with no solution. But how do these geometrical configurations manifest themselves algebraically?</p>
