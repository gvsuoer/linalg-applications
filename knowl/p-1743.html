<p>Of course, we didn't have to write both products because multiplication of real numbers is a commutative operation. There are a couple of important things to note about multiplicative inverses — we can use the inverses of the number <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> to solve the simple linear equation <span class="process-math">\(ax+b = c\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> (<span class="process-math">\(x = a^{-1}(c-b)\)</span>), and not every real number has an inverse. The latter means that the inverse is not defined on the entire set of real numbers. We can extend the idea of inverses to matrices, although we will see that there are many more matrices than just the zero matrix that do not have inverses.</p>
