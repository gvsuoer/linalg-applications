<div class="introduction">
<p>Carl Friedrich Gauss is often credited with inventing the method of least squares. He used the method to find a best-fit ellipse which allowed him to correctly predict the orbit of the asteroid Ceres as it passed behind the sun in 1801. (Adrien-Marie Legendre appears to be the first to publish the method, though.) Here we examine the problem of fitting an ellipse to data.</p>
<p>An ellipse is a quadratic equation that can be written in the form</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation}
x^2 + By^2 + Cxy + Dx + Ey + F = 0\tag{26.10}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p class="continuation">for constants <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(C\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(D\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(E\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(F\text{,}\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(B &gt; 0\text{.}\)</span> We will find the best-fit ellipse in the least squares sense through the points</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
(0,2), \ (2,1), \ (1, -1), \ (-1, -2), \ (-3,1), \ \text{ and }  \ (-1, -1)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>A picture of the best fit ellipse is shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_ellipse.html" title="Figure 26.17">Figure 26.17</a>.</p>

<p>Find the system of linear equations that would result if the ellipse <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_ellipse.html" title="Equation 26.10">(26.10)</a> were to exactly pass through the given points.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>
<p>Write the linear system from part (a) in the form <span class="process-math">\(A \vx = \vb\text{,}\)</span> where the vector <span class="process-math">\(\vx\)</span> contains the unknowns in the system.

<p>Find the least squares ellipse to this set of points. Make sure your method is clear. (Note that we are really fitting a surface of the form <span class="process-math">\(f(x,y) = x^2 + By^2 + Cxy + Dx + Ey + F\)</span> to a set of data points in the <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span>-plane. So the error is the sum of the vertical distances from the points in the <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span>-plane to the surface.)</p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="chap_least_squares.html#project-84" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
