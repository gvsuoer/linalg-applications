<p>We summarize the steps of the (partial) elimination on matrices we used above to solve a general linear system in the variables <span class="process-math">\(x_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x_2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\ldots\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x_n\text{.}\)</span></p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Interchange equations if needed to ensure that the coefficient of <span class="process-math">\(x_1\)</span> (or, more generally, the first non-zero variable) in the first equation is non-zero.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the first equation to eliminate <span class="process-math">\(x_1\)</span> (or, the first non-zero variable) from other equations by adding a multiple of the first equation to the others.</p></li>
<li><p>After <span class="process-math">\(x_1\)</span> is eliminated from all equations but the first equation, focus on the rest of the equations. Repeat the process of elimination on these equations to eliminate <span class="process-math">\(x_2\)</span> (or, the next non-zero variable) all but the second equation.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the process of eliminating variables recursively is finished, solve for the variables in a backwards fashion starting with the last equation and substituting known values in the equations above as they become known.</p></li>
