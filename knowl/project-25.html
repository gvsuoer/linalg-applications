<div class="introduction"><p>We introduce a little notation to help us describe the efficiency of our calculations. We won't be formal with this notation, rather work with it in an informal way. Big O (the letter “O” ) notation is used to describe the complexity of an algorithm. Generally speaking, in computer science big O notation can be used to describe the run time of an algorithm, the space used by the algorithm, or the number of computations required. The letter “O” is used because the behavior described is also called the order. Big O measures the asymptotic time of an algorithm, not its exact time. For example, if it takes <span class="process-math">\(6n^2-n+8\)</span> steps to complete an algorithm, then we say that the algorithm grows at the order of <span class="process-math">\(n^2\)</span> (we ignore the constants and the smaller power terms, since they become insignificant as <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> increases) and we describe its growth as <span class="process-math">\(O{\left(n^2\right)}\text{.}\)</span> To measure the efficiency of an algorithm to determine a matrix product, we will measure the number of operations it takes to calculate the product.</p></div>

<div class="introduction"><p>The standard algorithm for calculating a matrix product of two <span class="process-math">\(n \times n\)</span> matrices requires <span class="process-math">\(n^3\)</span> multiplications and a number of additions. Since additions are much less costly in terms of operations, the standard matrix product is <span class="process-math">\(O{\left(n^3\right)}\text{.}\)</span> We won't show it here, but using Strassen's algorithm on a product of <span class="process-math">\(2^m \times 2^m\)</span> matrices is <span class="process-math">\(O{\left(n^{\log_2(7)}\right)}\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(n = 2^m\text{.}\)</span> That means that Strassen's algorithm applied to an <span class="process-math">\(n \times n\)</span> matrix (where <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is a power of <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span>) requires approximately <span class="process-math">\(n^{\log_2(7)}\)</span> multiplications. We use this to analyze situations to determine when Strassen's algorithm is computationally more efficient than the standard algorithm.</p></div>
