<div class="introduction">
<p>Part (a) shows that our solutions to the differential equation <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act_de_second.html" title="Equation 39.5">(39.5)</a> are exponential of the form <span class="process-math">\(e^{rt}\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> is a solution to the auxiliary equation. Recall that if we can find two linearly independent solutions to <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act_de_second.html" title="Equation 39.5">(39.5)</a>, then we have found a basis for the eigenspace <span class="process-math">\(E_{-k}\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(mD^2+bD\)</span> with eigenvalue <span class="process-math">\(-k\text{.}\)</span> The quadratic equation shows that the roots of the auxiliary equation are</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/act_de_second.html ./knowl/act_de_second.html">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4mk}}{2m}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">As we will see, our basis depends on the types of roots the auxiliary equation has.</p>
</div>
<article class="task exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(i)</span></h6>
<p>Assume that the roots <span class="process-math">\(r_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(r_2\)</span> of the auxiliary equation are real and distinct. That means that <span class="process-math">\(y_1 = e^{r_1t}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y_2 = e^{r_2t}\)</span> are eigenfunctions in <span class="process-math">\(E_{-k}\text{.}\)</span> Use the Wronskian to show that <span class="process-math">\(\{y_1, y_2\}\)</span> is a basis for <span class="process-math">\(E_{-k}\)</span> in this case. Then describe the behavior of an arbitrary eigenfunction in <span class="process-math">\(E_{-2}\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(mD^2+bD = D^2+3D\)</span> and how it relates to damping. Draw a representative solution to illustrate. (In this case we say that the system is <dfn class="terminology">overdamped</dfn>. These systems can oscillate at most once, then they quickly damp to <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span>)</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(ii)</span></h6>
<p>Now suppose that we have a repeated real root <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> to the auxiliary equation. Then there is only one exponential function <span class="process-math">\(y_1 = e^{rt}\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(E_{-k}\text{.}\)</span> In this case, show that <span class="process-math">\(y_2 = te^{rt}\)</span> is also in <span class="process-math">\(E_{-k}\)</span> and that <span class="process-math">\(\{y_1, y_2\}\)</span> is a basis for <span class="process-math">\(E_{-k}\text{.}\)</span> Then describe the behavior of an arbitrary eigenfunction in <span class="process-math">\(E_{-1}\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(mD^2+bD = D^2+2D\)</span> and how it relates to damping. Draw a representative solution to illustrate. (In this case we say that the system is <dfn class="terminology">critically damped</dfn>. These systems behave similar to the overdamped systems in that they do not oscillations. However, if the damping is reduced just a little, the system can oscillate.)</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(iii)</span></h6>
<p>The last case is when the auxiliary equation has complex roots <span class="process-math">\(z_1 = u+vi\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(z_2 = u-vi\text{.}\)</span> We want to work with real valued functions, so we need to determine real valued solutions from these complex roots. To resolve this problem, we note that if <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is a real number, then <span class="process-math">\(e^{ix} = \cos(x) + i \sin(x)\text{.}\)</span> So</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
e^{(u+vi)t} = e^{ut}e^{ivt} = e^{ut} \cos(vt) + e^{ut}\sin(vt)i\text{.}

<p class="continuation">Show that <span class="process-math">\(\{e^{ut} \cos(vt),
e^{ut} \sin(vt)\}\)</span> is a basis for <span class="process-math">\(E_{-k}\)</span> in this case.
