<p>In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act_PA1_f_1.html" title="Task 6.1.a">Task 6.1.a</a> we saw that <span class="process-math">\(\vb\)</span> could be written in infinitely many different ways as a linear combination of the vectors <span class="process-math">\(\vv_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vv_2\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vv_3\text{.}\)</span> However, the vector <span class="process-math">\(\vb\)</span> could only be written in one way as a linear combination of <span class="process-math">\(\vv_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vv_2\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(\vb\)</span> is in <span class="process-math">\(\Span \{\vv_1, \vv_2, \vv_3\}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vb\)</span> is also in <span class="process-math">\(\Span \{\vv_1, \vv_2\}\text{.}\)</span> This raises a question — is <em class="emphasis">any</em> vector in <span class="process-math">\(\Span \{\vv_1, \vv_2, \vv_3\}\)</span> also in <span class="process-math">\(\Span\{\vv_1, \vv_2\}\text{.}\)</span> If so, then the vector <span class="process-math">\(\vv_3\)</span> is redundant in terms of forming the span of <span class="process-math">\(\vv_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vv_2\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vv_3\text{.}\)</span> For the sake of efficiency, we want to recognize and eliminate this redundancy.</p>
