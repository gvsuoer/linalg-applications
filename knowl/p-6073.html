<p>In calculus, a Taylor polynomial for a function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is a polynomial approximation that fits <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> well around the center of the approximation. For this reason, Taylor polynomials are good <dfn class="terminology">local</dfn> approximations, but they are not in general good global approximations. In particular, if a function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has periodic behavior it is impossible to model <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> well globally with polynomials that have infinite limits at infinity. For these kinds of functions, trigonometric polynomials are better choices. Trigonometric polynomials lead us to Fourier series, and we will investigate how inner products allow us to use trigonometric polynomials to model musical tones later in this section.</p>
