<p>When we receive a signal, we need to interpret it, and that is difficult if we cannot find a solution. One reason that the system might not have a solution is that the elements in <span class="process-math">\(\vx\)</span> have to come from a specified alphabet, and so we are looking for solutions that are in that alphabet, and there may be no direct solution in that alphabet. As a result, we generally have to find a “best” solution in the alphabet space. That can be done with the QR decomposition. Assume that <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> has a QR decomposition <span class="process-math">\(H = QR\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> having orthonormal columns and <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> a diagonal matrix. Explain how the equation <span class="process-math">\(\vy = H\vx\)</span> can be transformed into</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation}
Q^{\tr} \vy = R\vx\text{.}\tag{25.2}
\end{equation}
