<p>During each time period every nation adds or subtracts from its armaments. In our model, we will consider three main effects on the changes in armaments: the defense effect, fatigue effect and the grievance effect. In this activity we will discuss each effect in turn and then create a model to represent a two nation arms race.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>We first consider the defense effect. In a two nation scenario, each nation may react to the potential threat implied by an arms buildup of the other nation. For example, if nation <span class="process-math">\(N_1\)</span> feels threatened by nation <span class="process-math">\(N_2\)</span> (think of South and North Korea, or Ukraine and Russia, for example), then nation <span class="process-math">\(N_2\)</span>'s level of armament might cause nation <span class="process-math">\(N_1\)</span> to increase its armament in response. We will let <span class="process-math">\(\delta_{12}\)</span> represent this effect of nation <span class="process-math">\(N_2\)</span>'s armament on the armament of nation <span class="process-math">\(N_1\text{.}\)</span> Nation <span class="process-math">\(N_1\)</span> will then increase (or decrease) its armament in time period <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> by the amount <span class="process-math">\(\delta_{12}a_2(n-1)\)</span> based on the armament of nation <span class="process-math">\(N_2\)</span> in time period <span class="process-math">\(n-1\text{.}\)</span> We will call <span class="process-math">\(\delta_{12}\)</span> a <em class="emphasis">defense coefficient</em>.<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-23-hidden.html" title="Footnote 23"><sup> 23 </sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Next we discuss the fatigue effect. Keeping a strong defense is an expensive and taxing enterprise, often exacting a heavy toll on the resources of a nation. For example, consider the fatigue that the U.S. experienced fighting wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, losing much hardware and manpower in these conflicts. Let <span class="process-math">\(\delta_{ii}\)</span> represent this <dfn class="terminology">fatigue factor</dfn> on nation <span class="process-math">\(i\text{.}\)</span> Think of <span class="process-math">\(\delta_{ii}\)</span> as a measure of how much the nation has to replace each year, so a positive fatigue factor means that the nation is adding to its armament. The fatigue factor produces an effect of <span class="process-math">\(\delta_{ii}a_i(n-1)\)</span> on the armament of nation <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> at time <span class="process-math">\(t=n\)</span> that is the effect of the armament at time <span class="process-math">\(t=n-1\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>The last factor we consider is what we will call a grievance factor. This can be thought of as the set of ambitions and/or grievances against other nations (such as the acquisition or reacquisition of territory currently belonging to another country). As an example, Argentina and Great Britain both claim the Falkland Islands as territory. In 1982 Argentina invaded the disputed Falkland Islands which resulted in a two-month long undeclared Falkland Islands war, which returned control to the British. It seems reasonable that one nation might want to have sufficient armament in place to support its claim if force becomes necessary. Assuming that these grievances and ambitions have a constant impact on the armament of a nation from year to year, let <span class="process-math">\(g_i\)</span> be this “grievance” constant for nation <span class="process-math">\(i\text{.}\)</span><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-24-hidden.html" title="Footnote 24"><sup> 24 </sup></a> The effect a grievance factor <span class="process-math">\(g_i\)</span> would have on the armament of nation <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> in year <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> would be to add <span class="process-math">\(g_i\)</span> directly to <span class="process-math">\(a_i(n-1)\text{,}\)</span> since the factor <span class="process-math">\(g_i\)</span> is constant from year to year (paying for arms and soldier's wages, for example) and does not depend on the amount of existing armament.</p></li>
