<p>Since integration of functions is difficult, approximation techniques for definite integrals are very important. In calculus we are introduced to various methods, e.g., the midpoint, trapezoid, and Simpson's rule, for approximating definite integrals. These methods divide the interval of integration into subintervals and then use values of the integrand at the endpoints to approximate the integral. These are useful methods when approximating integrals from tabulated data, but there are better methods for other types of integrands. If we make judicious choices in the points we use to evaluate the integrand, we can obtain more accurate results with less work. One such method is Gaussian quadrature (which, for example, is widely used in solving problems of radiation heat transfer in direct integration of the equation of transfer of radiation over space), which we explore later in this section. This method utilizes the Gram-Schmidt process to produce orthogonal polynomials.</p>
