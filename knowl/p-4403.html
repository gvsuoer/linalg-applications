<p>NBC was awarded the U.S. television broadcast rights to the 2016 and 2020 summer Olympic games. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/T_LS_Olympics.html" title="Table 26.1: Olympics television broadcast rights.">Table 26.1</a> lists the amounts paid (in millions of dollars) by NBC sports for the 2008 through 2012 summer Olympics plus the recently concluded bidding for the 2016 and 2020 Olympics, where year 0 is the year 2008. (We will assume a simple model here, ignoring variations such as value of money due to inflation, viewership data which might affect NBC's expected revenue, etc.) <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_LS_Olympics.html" title="Figure 26.2">Figure 26.2</a> shows a plot of the data. Our goal in this activity is to find a linear function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> defined by <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = a_0 + a_1x\)</span> that fits the data well.</p>
