<p>Now suppose that we have a repeated real root <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> to the auxiliary equation. Then there is only one exponential function <span class="process-math">\(y_1 = e^{rt}\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(E_{-k}\text{.}\)</span> In this case, show that <span class="process-math">\(y_2 = te^{rt}\)</span> is also in <span class="process-math">\(E_{-k}\)</span> and that <span class="process-math">\(\{y_1, y_2\}\)</span> is a basis for <span class="process-math">\(E_{-k}\text{.}\)</span> Then describe the behavior of an arbitrary eigenfunction in <span class="process-math">\(E_{-1}\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(mD^2+bD = D^2+2D\)</span> and how it relates to damping. Draw a representative solution to illustrate. (In this case we say that the system is <dfn class="terminology">critically damped</dfn>. These systems behave similar to the overdamped systems in that they do not oscillations. However, if the damping is reduced just a little, the system can oscillate.)</p>
