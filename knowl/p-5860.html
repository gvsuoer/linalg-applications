<p>Suppose we were to film an experiment involving a ball that is bouncing up and down. Naively, we set up several cameras to follow the process of the experiment from different perspectives and collect the data. All of this data tells us something about the bouncing ball, but there may be no perspective that tells us an important piece of information — the axis along which the ball bounces. The question, then, is how we can extract from the data this important piece of information. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a tool for just this type of analysis.</p>
