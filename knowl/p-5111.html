<p>The first step in compressing an image is to digitize the image. There are many ways to do this and we will consider one of the simplest ways and only work with gray-scale images, with the scale from 0 (black) to 255 (white). A digital image can be created by taking a small grid of squares (called pixels) and coloring each pixel with some shade of gray. The resolution of this grid is a measure of how many pixels are used per square inch. As an example, consider the 16 by 16 pixel picture of a flower shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Fig_7_c_Flower.html" title="Figure 30.1">Figure 30.1</a>.</p>
