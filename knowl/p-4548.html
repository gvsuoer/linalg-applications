<p>We have seen how to diagonalize a matrix — if we can find <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> linearly independent eigenvectors of an <span class="process-math">\(n\times n\)</span> matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and let <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> be the matrix whose columns are those eigenvectors, then <span class="process-math">\(P^{-1}AP\)</span> is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues down the diagonal in the same order corresponding to the eigenvectors placed in <span class="process-math">\(P\text{.}\)</span> We will see that in certain cases we can take this one step further and create an orthogonal matrix with eigenvectors as columns to diagonalize a matrix. This is called orthogonal diagonalization. Orthogonal diagonalizability is useful in that it allows us to find a “convenient” coordinate system in which to interpret the results of certain matrix transformations. A set of orthonormal basis vectors for an orthogonally diagonalizable matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is called a set of <dfn class="terminology">principal axes</dfn> for <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> Orthogonal diagonalization will also play a crucial role in the singular value decomposition of a matrix, a decomposition that has been described by some as the “pinnacle” of linear algebra.</p>
