<p>The last factor we consider is what we will call a grievance factor. This can be thought of as the set of ambitions and/or grievances against other nations (such as the acquisition or reacquisition of territory currently belonging to another country). As an example, Argentina and Great Britain both claim the Falkland Islands as territory. In 1982 Argentina invaded the disputed Falkland Islands which resulted in a two-month long undeclared Falkland Islands war, which returned control to the British. It seems reasonable that one nation might want to have sufficient armament in place to support its claim if force becomes necessary. Assuming that these grievances and ambitions have a constant impact on the armament of a nation from year to year, let <span class="process-math">\(g_i\)</span> be this “grievance” constant for nation <span class="process-math">\(i\text{.}\)</span><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-24-hidden.html" title="Footnote 24"><sup> 24 </sup></a> The effect a grievance factor <span class="process-math">\(g_i\)</span> would have on the armament of nation <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> in year <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> would be to add <span class="process-math">\(g_i\)</span> directly to <span class="process-math">\(a_i(n-1)\text{,}\)</span> since the factor <span class="process-math">\(g_i\)</span> is constant from year to year (paying for arms and soldier's wages, for example) and does not depend on the amount of existing armament.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="chap_matrix_inverse.html#li-328" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
