<p>Just as we were able to define an algebra of vectors with addition and multiplication by scalars, we can define an algebra of matrices. We will see that the properties of these operations on matrices are immediate generalizations of the properties of the operations on vectors. We will then see how the matrix product arises through the connection of matrices to linear transformations. Finally, we define the transpose of a matrix. The transpose of a matrix will be useful in applications such as graph theory and least-squares fitting of curves, as well as in advanced topics such as inner product spaces and the dual space of a vector space.</p>
