<p>If <span class="process-math">\(\CB = \{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_m\}\)</span> is a basis for a subspace <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{,}\)</span> we know that any vector <span class="process-math">\(\vw\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> can be written uniquely as a linear combination of the vectors in <span class="process-math">\(\CB\text{.}\)</span> In the past, the way we have found the coordinates of <span class="process-math">\(\vx\)</span> with respect to <span class="process-math">\(\CB\text{,}\)</span> i.e. the weights needed to write a vector <span class="process-math">\(\vx\)</span> as a linear combination of the elements in <span class="process-math">\(\CB\text{,}\)</span> has been to row reduce the matrix <span class="process-math">\([\vv_1 \ \vv_2 \ \cdots \ \vv_m \ | \ \vx]\)</span> to solve the corresponding system. This can be a cumbersome process, especially if we need to do it many times. This process also forces us to determine all of the weights at once. For certain types of bases, namely the <dfn class="terminology">orthogonal</dfn> and <dfn class="terminology">orthonormal</dfn> bases, there is a much easier way to find individual weights for this linear combination.</p>
