<p>The digital age has brought many new opportunities for the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information. Along with these opportunities come new difficulties as well. All of this digital information must be stored in some way and be retrievable in an efficient manner. A singular value decomposition of digitally stored information can be used to compress the information or clean up corrupted information. In this section we will see how a singular value decomposition can be used in image compression. While a singular value decomposition is normally used with very large matrices, we will restrict ourselves to small examples so that we can more clearly see how a singular value decomposition is applied.</p>
