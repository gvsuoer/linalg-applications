<p>Recall the hat problem from the beginning of this section. Three players are assigned either a red or blue hat and can only see the colors of the hats of the other players. The goal is to devise a high probability strategy for one player to correctly guess the color of their hat. The players have a 50% chance of winning if one player guesses randomly and all of the others pass. However, the group can do better than 50% with a reasonably simple strategy. There are 2 possibilities for each hat color for a total of <span class="process-math">\(2^3 = 8\)</span> possible distributions of hat colors. Of these, only red-red-red and blue-blue-blue contain only one hat color, so <span class="process-math">\(6/8\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(3/4\)</span> of the possible hat distributions have two hats of one color and one of the other color. So if a player sees two hats of the same color, that player guesses the other color and passes otherwise. This gives a 75% chance of winning. This strategy will only work for three players, though. We want to develop an effective strategy that works for larger groups of players.</p>
