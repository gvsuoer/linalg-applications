<p>Two students are talking about when a matrix transformation is one-to-one. <blockquote class="blockquote">Student 1: If we have a matrix transformation, then we need to check that <span class="process-math">\(A\vx=\vb\)</span> has a unique solution for every <span class="process-math">\(\vb\)</span> for which <span class="process-math">\(A\vx=\vb\)</span> has a solution, right?</blockquote> <blockquote class="blockquote">Student 2: Well, that's the definition. Each <span class="process-math">\(\vb\)</span> in the codomain has to be the image of at most one <span class="process-math">\(\vx\)</span> in the domain. So when <span class="process-math">\(\vb\)</span> is in the range, corresponding to <span class="process-math">\(A\vx=\vb\)</span> having a solution, then there is exactly one solution <span class="process-math">\(\vx\text{.}\)</span>
</blockquote> <blockquote class="blockquote">Student 1: But wouldn't it be enough to check that <span class="process-math">\(A\vx=\vzero\)</span> has a unique solution? Doesn't that translate to the other <span class="process-math">\(\vb\)</span> vectors? If there is a unique solution for one <span class="process-math">\(\vb_1\text{,}\)</span> then there can't be infinitely many solutions for another <span class="process-math">\(\vb_2\text{.}\)</span>
</blockquote> <blockquote class="blockquote">Student 2: I don't know. It feels to me as if changing the right hand side could change whether there is a unique solution, or infinitely many solutions, or no solution.</blockquote> Which part of the above conversation do you agree with? Which parts need fixing?</p>
