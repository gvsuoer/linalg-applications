<div class="introduction"><p>A matrix inverse is extremely useful in solving matrix equations and can help us in solving systems of equations. Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is an invertible matrix, i.e., there exists <span class="process-math">\(A^{-1}\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(AA^{-1}=A^{-1}A=I_n\text{.}\)</span></p></div>
<article class="task exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(A)</span></h6>
<p>Consider the system <span class="process-math">\(A\vx=\vb\text{.}\)</span> Use the inverse of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to show that this system has a solution for every <span class="process-math">\(\vb\)</span> and find an expression for this solution in terms of <span class="process-math">\(\vb\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(A^{-1}\text{.}\)</span> (Note that since matrix multiplication is not commutative, we have to pay attention to the order in which we multiply matrices. For example, <span class="process-math">\(A^{-1}AB=B\)</span> while we cannot simplify <span class="process-math">\(ABA^{-1}\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> unless <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> commute.)</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(B)</span></h6>
<p>If <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> are matrices and <span class="process-math">\(A+C = B+C\text{,}\)</span> then we can subtract the matrix <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> from both sides to see that <span class="process-math">\(A = B\text{.}\)</span> We saw in <a href="chap_matrix_operations.html" class="internal" title="Section 8: Matrix Operations">SectionÂ 8</a> that there is no corresponding general cancellation property for matrix multiplication when we found that <span class="process-math">\(AB=AC\)</span> could hold while <span class="process-math">\(B\neq C\text{.}\)</span> However, we can cancel <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> from this equation in certain circumstances. Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(AB=AC\)</span> and that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is an invertible matrix. Show that we can cancel <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> in this case and conclude that <span class="process-math">\(B=C\text{.}\)</span> (Note: When simplifying the product of matrices, again keep in mind that matrix multiplication is not commutative.)</p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="chap_matrix_inverse.html#task-555" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
