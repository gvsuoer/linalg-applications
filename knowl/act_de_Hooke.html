<div class="introduction">
<p>As a specific example of a second order linear equation, as discussed at the beginning of this section, Hooke's law states that if a mass is hanging from a spring, the force acting on the spring is proportional to the displacement of the spring from equilibrium. If we let <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> be the displacement of the object from its equilibrium, and ignore any resistance, the position of the mass-spring system can be represented by the differential equation</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/eq_de_Hooke.html">
\begin{equation*}
mD^2(y) = -ky\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">where <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> is the mass of the object and <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is a positive constant that depends on the spring. Assuming that the mass is positive, we can divide both sides by <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> and rewrite this differential equation in the form</p>

\begin{equation}
D^2(y) = -cy\tag{39.3}

<p class="continuation">where <span class="process-math">\(c = \frac{k}{m}\text{.}\)</span> So the solutions to the differential equation <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_de_Hooke.html" title="Equation 39.3">(39.3)</a> make up the eigenspace <span class="process-math">\(E_{-c}\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(D^2\)</span> with eigenvalue <span class="process-math">\(-c\text{.}\)</span></p>

<p>Since the derivatives of <span class="process-math">\(\sin(t)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\cos(t)\)</span> are scalar multiples of <span class="process-math">\(\sin(t)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\cos(t)\text{,}\)</span> it may be reasonable that these make up solutions to <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_de_Hooke.html" title="Equation 39.3">(39.3)</a>. Show that <span class="process-math">\(y_1 = c\cos(t)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y_2 = c\sin(t)\)</span> are both in <span class="process-math">\(E_{-c}\text{.}\)</span></p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>
<p>As functions, the cosine and sine are related in many ways (e.g., the Pythagorean Identity). An important property for this application is the linear independence of the cosine and sine. Show, using the <em class="emphasis">definition</em> of linear independence, that the cosine and sine functions are linearly independent in <span class="process-math">\(\F\text{.}\)</span></p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h5>
<p>Part (a) shows that there are at least two different functions in <span class="process-math">\(E_{-c}\text{.}\)</span> To solve a differential equation is to find all of the solutions to the differential equation. In other words, we want to completely determine the eigenspace <span class="process-math">\(E_{-c}\text{.}\)</span> We have already seen that any function <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> of the form <span class="process-math">\(y(t) = c_1 \cos(t) + c_2 \sin(t)\)</span> is a solution to the differential equation <span class="process-math">\(mD^2(y) = -ky\text{.}\)</span> The theory of linear differential equations tells us that there is a unique solution to <span class="process-math">\(mD^2(y) = -ky\)</span> if we specify two initial conditions. What this means is that to show that any solution <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> to the differential equation <span class="process-math">\(mD^2(y) = -ky\)</span> with two initial values <span class="process-math">\(z(t_0)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(z'(t_0)\)</span> for some scalar <span class="process-math">\(t_0\)</span> is of the form <span class="process-math">\(y = c_1 \cos(t) + c_2 \sin(t)\text{,}\)</span> we need to verify that there are values of <span class="process-math">\(c_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c_2\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(y(t_0) = z(t_0)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y'(t_0) = z'(t_0)\text{.}\)</span> Here we will use this idea to show that any function in <span class="process-math">\(E_{-c}\)</span> is a linear combination of <span class="process-math">\(\cos(t)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\sin(t)\text{.}\)</span> That is, that the set <span class="process-math">\(\{\cos, \sin\}\)</span> spans <span class="process-math">\(E_{-c}\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(y = c_1 \cos(t) + c_2 \sin(t)\text{.}\)</span> Show that there are values for <span class="process-math">\(c_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c_2\)</span> such that</p>
