<div class="introduction">
<p>As a specific example of a second order linear equation, as discussed at the beginning of this section, Hooke's law states that if a mass is hanging from a spring, the force acting on the spring is proportional to the displacement of the spring from equilibrium. If we let <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> be the displacement of the object from its equilibrium, and ignore any resistance, the position of the mass-spring system can be represented by the differential equation</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/eq_de_Hooke.html">
\begin{equation*}
mD^2(y) = -ky\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">where <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> is the mass of the object and <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is a positive constant that depends on the spring. Assuming that the mass is positive, we can divide both sides by <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> and rewrite this differential equation in the form</p>

D^2(y) = -cy\tag{39.3}

<p>Since the derivatives of <span class="process-math">\(\sin(t)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\cos(t)\)</span> are scalar multiples of <span class="process-math">\(\sin(t)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\cos(t)\text{,}\)</span> it may be reasonable that these make up solutions to <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_de_Hooke.html" title="Equation 39.3">(39.3)</a>. Show that <span class="process-math">\(y_1 = c\cos(t)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y_2 = c\sin(t)\)</span> are both in <span class="process-math">\(E_{-c}\text{.}\)</span></p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>
<p>As functions, the cosine and sine are related in many ways (e.g., the Pythagorean Identity). An important property for this application is the linear independence of the cosine and sine.

<p>Part (a) shows that there are at least two different functions in <span class="process-math">\(E_{-c}\text{.}\)</span> To solve a differential equation is to find all of the solutions to the differential equation. In other words, we want to completely determine the eigenspace <span class="process-math">\(E_{-c}\text{.}\)</span> We have already seen that any function <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> of the form <span class="process-math">\(y(t) = c_1 \cos(t) + c_2 \sin(t)\)</span> is a solution to the differential equation <span class="process-math">\(mD^2(y) = -ky\text{.}\)</span> The theory of linear differential equations tells us that there is a unique solution to <span class="process-math">\(mD^2(y) = -ky\)</span> if we specify two initial conditions. What this means is that to show that any solution <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> to the differential equation <span class="process-math">\(mD^2(y) = -ky\)</span> with two initial values <span class="process-math">\(z(t_0)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(z'(t_0)\)</span> for some scalar <span class="process-math">\(t_0\)</span> is of the form <span class="process-math">\(y = c_1 \cos(t) + c_2 \sin(t)\text{,}\)</span> we need to verify that there are values of <span class="process-math">\(c_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c_2\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(y(t_0) = z(t_0)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y'(t_0) = z'(t_0)\text{.}\)</span> Here we will use this idea to show that any function in <span class="process-math">\(E_{-c}\)</span> is a linear combination of <span class="process-math">\(\cos(t)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\sin(t)\text{.}\)</span> That is, that the set <span class="process-math">\(\{\cos, \sin\}\)</span> spans <span class="process-math">\(E_{-c}\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(y = c_1 \cos(t) + c_2 \sin(t)\text{.}\)</span> Show that there are values for <span class="process-math">\(c_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c_2\)</span> such that</p>
