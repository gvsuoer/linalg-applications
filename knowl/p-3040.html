<p>Pour cream into your cup of coffee and the cream spreads out; straighten up your room and it soon becomes messy again; when gasoline is mixed with air in a car's cylinders, it explodes if a spark is introduced. In each of these cases a transition from a low energy state (your room is straightened up) to a higher energy state (a messy, disorganized room) occurs. This can be described by entropy — a measure of the energy in a system. Low energy is organized (like ice cubes) and higher energy is not (like water vapor). It is a fundamental property of energy (as described by the second law of thermodynamics) that the entropy of a system cannot decrease. In other words, in the absence of any external intervention, things never become more organized.</p>
