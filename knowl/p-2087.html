<p>To show that a subset <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> is a subspace of <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{,}\)</span> we need to prove the following:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(\vu + \vv\)</span> is in <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> whenever <span class="process-math">\(\vu\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> are in <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> (when this property is satisfied we say that <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> is <dfn class="terminology">closed</dfn> under addition),</p></li>
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(a \vu\)</span> is in <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> whenever <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is a scalar and <span class="process-math">\(\vu\)</span> is in <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> (when this property is satisfied we say that <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> is <dfn class="terminology">closed</dfn> under multiplication by scalars),</p></li>
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(\vzero\)</span> is in <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
</ol>
<p class="continuation">The remaining properties of a vector space are properties of the operation, and as long as we use the same operations as in <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{,}\)</span> the operation properties follow the operations.</p>
