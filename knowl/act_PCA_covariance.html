<div class="introduction"><p>To compare the two one dimensional data vectors, we need to consider variance and covariance.</p></div>
<article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h5>
<p>It is often useful to know how spread out a data set is, something the average doesn't tell us. For example, the data sets <span class="process-math">\([1 \ 2 \ 3]^{\tr}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\([-2 \ 0 \ 8]^{\tr}\)</span> both have averages of <span class="process-math">\(2\text{,}\)</span> but the data in <span class="process-math">\([-2 \ 0 \ 8]^{\tr}\)</span> is more spread out. Variance provides one measure of how spread out a one-dimensional data set <span class="process-math">\(\vx = [x_1 \ x_2 \ x_3 \ \cdots \ x_n]^{\tr}\)</span> is. Variance is defined as</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\var(\vx) = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left(x_i - \overline{\vx} \right)^2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>

<p>In general, we will have more than one-dimensional data, as in our SAT data set. It will be helpful to have a way to compare one-dimensional data sets to try to capture the idea of variance for different data sets — how much the data in two different data sets varies from the mean with respect to each other. One such measure is covariance — essentially the average of all corresponding products of deviations from the means. We define the covariance of two data vectors <span class="process-math">\(\vx = [x_1 \ x_2 \ \cdots \ x_n]^{\tr}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vy = [y_1 \ y_2 \ \cdots \ y_n]^{\tr}\)</span> as</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\cov(\vx,\vy) = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left(x_i-\overline{\vx}\right)\left(y_i-\overline{\vy}\right)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Determine all covariances</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\cov(\vx_1,\vx_1), \  \cov(\vx_1,\vx_2), \  \cov(\vx_2,\vx_1), \ \text{ and }  \ \cov(\vx_2,\vx_2)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">How are <span class="process-math">\(\cov(\vx_1,\vx_2)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\cov(\vx_2,\vx_1)\)</span> related? How are  <span class="process-math">\(\cov(\vx_1,\vx_1)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\cov(\vx_2,\vx_2)\)</span> related to variances?</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h5>
<p>What is most important about covariance is its sign. Suppose <span class="process-math">\(\vy = [y_1 \ y_2 \ \ldots \ y_n]^{\tr}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vz = [z_1 \ z_2 \ \ldots \ z_n]^{\tr}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\cov(\vy,\vz) &gt; 0\text{.}\)</span> Then if <span class="process-math">\(y_i\)</span> is larger than <span class="process-math">\(y_j\)</span> it is likely that <span class="process-math">\(z_i\)</span> is also larger than <span class="process-math">\(z_j\text{.}\)</span> For example, if <span class="process-math">\(\vy\)</span> is a vector that records a persons height from age <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vz\)</span> records that same person's weight in the same years, we might expect that when <span class="process-math">\(y_i\)</span> increases so does <span class="process-math">\(z_i\text{.}\)</span> Similarly, if <span class="process-math">\(\cov(\vy,\vz) \lt 0\text{,}\)</span> then as one data set increases, the other decreases. As an example, if <span class="process-math">\(\vy\)</span> records the number of hours a student spends playing video games each semester ad <span class="process-math">\(\vz\)</span> gives the student's GPA for each semester, then we might expect that <span class="process-math">\(z_i\)</span> decreases as <span class="process-math">\(y_i\)</span> increases. When <span class="process-math">\(\cov(\vy,\vz) = 0\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(\vy\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vz\)</span> are said to be uncorrelated or independent of each other. For our example <span class="process-math">\(\vx_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vx_2\text{,}\)</span> what does <span class="process-math">\(\cov(\vx_1,\vx_2)\)</span> tell us about the relationship between <span class="process-math">\(\vx_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vx_2\text{?}\)</span> Why should we expect this from the context?</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h5>
<p>The covariance gives us information about the relationships between the attributes. So instead of working with the original data, we work with the covariance data. If we have <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> data vectors <span class="process-math">\(\vx_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vx_2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\ldots\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vx_m\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{,}\)</span> the <dfn class="terminology">covariance matrix</dfn> <span class="process-math">\(C = [c_{ij}]\)</span> satisfies <span class="process-math">\(c_{ij} = \cov(\vx_i, \vx_j)\text{.}\)</span> Calculate the covariance matrix for our SAT data. Then explain why <span class="process-math">\(C = \frac{1}{n-1}XX^{\tr}\text{.}\)</span></p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="chap_dimension.html#act_PCA_covariance" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
