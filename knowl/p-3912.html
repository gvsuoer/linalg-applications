<p>Determining a “best” solution to a problem often involves finding a solution that minimizes a distance. We generally accomplish a minimization through orthogonality — which depends on the angle between vectors. Given two vectors <span class="process-math">\(\vu\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{,}\)</span> we position the vectors so that they emanate from the same initial point. If the vectors are nonzero, then they determine a plane in <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{.}\)</span> In that plane there are two angles that these vectors create. We will define the angle between the vectors to be the smaller of these two angles. The dot product will tell us how to find the angle between vectors. Let <span class="process-math">\(\vu\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> be vectors in <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\theta\)</span> the angle between them as illustrated in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_Angle.html" title="Figure 23.10">Figure 23.10</a>.</p>
