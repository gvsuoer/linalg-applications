<p>Recall that two nonzero vectors <span class="process-math">\(\vu\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> are orthogonal if <span class="process-math">\(\vu \cdot \vv = 0\text{.}\)</span> We can extend this idea to an entire set. For example, the standard basis <span class="process-math">\(\CS = \{\ve_1, \ve_2, \ve_3\}\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\)</span> has the property that any two distinct vectors in <span class="process-math">\(\CS\)</span> are orthogonal to each other. The basis vectors in <span class="process-math">\(\CS\)</span> make a very nice coordinate system for <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\text{,}\)</span> where the basis vectors provide the directions for the coordinate axes. We could rotate this standard basis, or multiply any of the vectors in the basis by a nonzero constant, and retain a basis in which all distinct vectors are orthogonal to each other (e.g., <span class="process-math">\(\{[2 \ 0 \ 0]^{\tr}, [0 \ 3 \ 0]^{\tr}, [0 \ 0 \ 1]^{\tr}\}\)</span>). We define this idea of having all vectors be orthogonal to each other for sets, and then for bases.</p>
