<p>We now consider this result in the general case of a <span class="process-math">\(k\times m\)</span> matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and an <span class="process-math">\(m \times n\)</span> matrix <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> define matrix transformations <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(T\text{,}\)</span> respectively. In other words, <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> are matrix transformations defined by <span class="process-math">\(S(\vx) = A\vx\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(T(\vx) = B\vx\text{.}\)</span> The domain of <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(\R^m\)</span> and the codomain is <span class="process-math">\(\R^k\text{.}\)</span> The domain of <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> and the codomain is <span class="process-math">\(\R^m\text{.}\)</span> The composition <span class="process-math">\(S\circ T\)</span> is defined because the output vectors of <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> are in <span class="process-math">\(\R^m\)</span> and they lie in the domain of <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span> The domain of <span class="process-math">\(S\circ T\)</span> is the same as the domain of <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> since the input vectors first go through the <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> transformation. The codomain of <span class="process-math">\(S\circ T\)</span> is the same as the codomain of <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> since the final output vectors are produced by applying the <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> transformation.</p>
