<p>The COVID-19 epidemic has generated many mathematical and statistical models to try to understand the spread of the virus. In this project we examine a simple stochastic model of the spread of an epidemic proposed by Norman Bailey in 1950.<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-64-hidden.html" title="Footnote 64"><sup> 64 </sup></a> This is a model of a relatively mild epidemic in which no one dies from the disease. Of course, mathematicians build on simple models to form more complicated and realistic ones, but this is a good, and accessible, starting point. Bailey writes about the the difficulties in the stochastic<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-65-hidden.html" title="Footnote 65"><sup> 65 </sup></a> analysis of epidemics. For example, the overall epidemic “can often be broken down into smaller epidemics occurring in separate regional subdivisions” and that these regional epidemics “are not necessarily in phase and often interact with each other”. This is behavior that has been clearly evident in the COVID-19 epidemic in the US. Even within a single district, “it is obvious that a given infectious individual has not the same chance of infecting each inhabitant. He will probably be in close contact with a small number of people only, perhaps of the order of 10-50, depending on the nature of his activities.” But then the epidemic for the whole district will “be built up from epidemics taking place in several relatively small groups of associates and acquaintances.” So we can see in this analysis that an epidemic can spread from small, localized areas.</p>
