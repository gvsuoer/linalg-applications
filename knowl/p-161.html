<p>Note that an <em class="emphasis">existential</em> statement is considered <em class="emphasis">true</em> if there is at least one example which makes is true. For example, the latter of the above statements — “one can find a system of two equations in two unknowns that has infinitely many solutions” — is an existential statement. For this statement to be true, existence of a system of two equations in two unknowns with infinitely many solutions should suffice. If it is impossible to find two such equations, then this statement is false.</p>
