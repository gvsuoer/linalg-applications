<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(T : V \to W\)</span> be a linear transformation from a vector space <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> to vector space <span class="process-math">\(W\text{,}\)</span> and let <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> be a subspace of <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(\vzero_V\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vzero_W\)</span> be the additive identities in <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(W\text{,}\)</span> respectively. We have already shown that <span class="process-math">\(T(\vzero_V) = \vzero_W\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(\vzero_W\)</span> is in <span class="process-math">\(T(U)\text{.}\)</span> To show that <span class="process-math">\(T(U)\)</span> is a subspace of <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> we must also demonstrate that <span class="process-math">\(\vw+\vz\)</span> is in <span class="process-math">\(T(U)\)</span> whenever <span class="process-math">\(\vw\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vz\)</span> are in <span class="process-math">\(T(U)\)</span> and that <span class="process-math">\(a\vw\)</span> is in <span class="process-math">\(T(U)\)</span> whenever <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is a scalar and <span class="process-math">\(\vw\)</span> is in <span class="process-math">\(T(U)\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(\vw\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vz\)</span> be in <span class="process-math">\(T(U)\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(T(\vx) = \vw\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(T(\vy) = \vz\)</span> for some vectors <span class="process-math">\(\vx\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vy\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(U\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> is a subspace of <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> we know that <span class="process-math">\(\vx+\vy\)</span> is in <span class="process-math">\(U\text{.}\)</span> The fact that <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is a linear transformation means that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
T(\vx + \vy) = T(\vx) + T(\vy) = \vw + \vz\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>So <span class="process-math">\(\vw+\vz\)</span> is in <span class="process-math">\(T(U)\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Finally, let <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> be a scalar. Since <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> is a subspace of <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> we know that <span class="process-math">\(a \vx\)</span> is in <span class="process-math">\(U\text{.}\)</span> The linearity of <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> gives us</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
T(a\vx) = aT(\vx) = a\vw\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">so <span class="process-math">\(a \vw\)</span> is in <span class="process-math">\(T(U)\text{.}\)</span> We conclude that <span class="process-math">\(T(U)\)</span> is a subspace of <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span></p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="chap_linear_transformation.html#proof-19" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
