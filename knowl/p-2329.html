<p>The Lights Out game starts with a <span class="process-math">\(5 \times 5\)</span> grid on which some of the squares are lit (on) and some are not lit (off). We will call such a state a <dfn class="terminology">configuration</dfn>. Pressing a square that is on turns it off and changes the state of all adjacent (vertically and horizontally) squares, and pressing a square that is off turns it on and changes the state of all adjacent (vertically and horizontally) squares. To model this situation, we consider the number system <span class="process-math">\(\Z_2 = \{0,1\}\)</span> consisting only of 0 and 1, where 0 represents the off state and 1 the on state. We can also think of 1 as the act of pressing a square and 0 as the act of not pressing — that is,</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(0+0 = 0\)</span> (not pressing an off square leaves it off),</p></li>
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(0+1 = 1 = 1 + 0\)</span> (pressing an off square turns it on or not pressing a lit square leaves it lit),</p></li>
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(1+1 = 0\)</span> (pressing a lit square turns it off).</p></li>
</ul>
