<p>In a MIMO system, every transmitter antenna sends a signal to every receiver antenna as illustrated in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_MIMO.html" title="Figure 25.1">Figure 25.1</a>. In each of these transmissions the signal can be disturbed in some way. Two types of disturbances are <dfn class="terminology">fading</dfn> and <dfn class="terminology">noise</dfn>. Fading is due to time variations in the received signal, which can occur because of atmospheric conditions or obstacles over the path which are varying with respect to time. In a MIMO system we have <dfn class="terminology">multipath fading</dfn> for the different paths the signal takes from different antennas to receivers, which causes fluctuations in amplitude, phase and angle of arrival of the received signal. Noise is an unwanted signal which interferes with actual signal. Both fading and noise result in a received signal that is different than the transmitted signal. The problem is how to recover the original signal from the transmitted signal. The QR decomposition is used in this process. To improve the efficiency of MIMO systems, different methods are introduced to determine a QR decomposition. We will discuss MIMO systems in more detail later in this section, and how Householder transformations can be used to find QR decompositions.</p>
