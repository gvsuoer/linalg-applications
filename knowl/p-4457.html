<p>The University of Denver Infant Study Center investigated whether babies take longer to learn to crawl in cold months, when they are often bundled in clothes that restrict their movement, than in warmer months. The study sought a relationship between babies' first crawling age and the average temperature during the month they first try to crawl (about 6 months after birth). Some of the data from the study is in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/T_7_d_infants.html" title="Table 26.12: Crawling age">Table 26.12</a>. Let <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> represent the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and <span class="process-math">\(C(x)\)</span> the average crawling age in months.</p>
