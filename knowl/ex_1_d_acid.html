<div class="introduction"><p>Suppose we have two different water-benzene-acetic acid solutions, one with 40% water, 50% benzene and 10% acetic acid, the other with 52% water, 42% benzene and 6% acid.</p></div>
<article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h5>
<p>An experiment we want to conduct requires a solution with 43% water, 48% benzene and 9% acid. Representing each acid solution as a vector, determine if we can we make this new acid solution by mixing the first two solutions, or do we have to run to the chemical solutions market to get the solution we want?</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>
<p>Using the water-benzene-acetic acid solutions in the previous problem, can we obtain an acid solution which contains 50% water, 43% benzene and 7% acid?</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h5>
<p>Determine the relationship between the percentages of water, benzene, and acid in solutions which can be obtained by mixing the two given water-benzene-acetic acid solutions above.</p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="chap_vector_representation.html#ex_1_d_acid" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
