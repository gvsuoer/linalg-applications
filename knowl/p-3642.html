<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(p(t,x)\)</span> be the characteristic polynomial of <span class="process-math">\(A(t)\text{.}\)</span> Note that these characteristic polynomials are functions of both <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> Since polynomials are continuous functions, their roots (the eigenvalues of <span class="process-math">\(A(t)\)</span>) are continuous for <span class="process-math">\(t \in [0,1]\)</span> as well. Let <span class="process-math">\(\lambda(t)\)</span> be an eigenvalue of <span class="process-math">\(A(t)\text{.}\)</span> Note that <span class="process-math">\(\lambda(1)\)</span> is an eigenvalue of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\lambda(0)\)</span> is one of the <span class="process-math">\(a_{ii}\)</span> and is therefore in <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span> We will argue that <span class="process-math">\(\lambda(t)\)</span> is in <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> for every value of <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\([0,1]\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(r_i\)</span> be the radius of <span class="process-math">\(D_i\)</span> and let <span class="process-math">\(D(t)_i\)</span> be the Gershgorin disk of <span class="process-math">\(A(t)\)</span> with the same center as <span class="process-math">\(D_i\)</span> and radius <span class="process-math">\(r(t)_i = tr_i\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(S(t) = \cup_{1 \leq i \leq m} D(s)_i\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(r(s)_i \leq r_i\text{,}\)</span> it follows that <span class="process-math">\(D(s)_i \subseteq D_i\)</span> and so <span class="process-math">\(S(t) \cap S' = \emptyset\)</span> as well. From topology, we know that since the disks <span class="process-math">\(D_i\)</span> are closed, the union <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> of these disks is also closed. Similarly, <span class="process-math">\(S(t)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(S'\)</span> are closed. Thus, <span class="process-math">\(\lambda(t)\)</span> is continuous in a closed set and so does not leave the set. Thus, <span class="process-math">\(\lambda(t)\)</span> is in <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> for every value of <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\([0,1]\text{.}\)</span></p>
