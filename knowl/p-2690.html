<p>The two bases <span class="process-math">\(S_1 = \{[1 \ 1]^{\tr}, [-1 \ 1]^{\tr}\}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(S_3 =\{[-2 \ 8]^{\tr}, [-1 \ 3]^{\tr}\}\)</span> from <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act_lattices_2.html" title="Project Activity 15.8">Project Activity 15.8</a> are shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_Lattice_3.html" title="Figure 15.10">Figure 15.10</a>. This figure illustrates how the matrix <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> transforms the basis <span class="process-math">\(S_1\text{,}\)</span> in which the vectors are perpendicular and short, to one in which the vectors are nearly parallel and significantly longer. So the matrix <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> converts the “good” basis <span class="process-math">\(S_1\)</span> into a “bad” basis <span class="process-math">\(S_2\text{,}\)</span> keeping the lattice intact. This is a key idea in the GGH cryptosystem. What makes this work is the fact that both <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(U^{-1}\)</span> have integer entries. The reason for this is that, for a <span class="process-math">\(2 \times 2\)</span> matrix <span class="process-math">\(U = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} a\amp b\\c\amp d \end{array} \right]\text{,}\)</span> we know that <span class="process-math">\(U^{-1} = \frac{1}{ad-bc} \left[ \begin{array}{rr} d\amp -b\\-c\amp a \end{array} \right]\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> has integer entries and <span class="process-math">\(ad-bc = \pm 1\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(U^{-1}\)</span> will also have integer entries. The number <span class="process-math">\(ad-bc\)</span> is called the <em class="emphasis">determinant</em> of <span class="process-math">\(U\text{,}\)</span> and matrices with determinant of <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(-1\)</span> are called <em class="emphasis">unimodular</em>. That what happened in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act_lattices_2.html" title="Project Activity 15.8">Project Activity 15.8</a> happens in the general case is the focus of the next activity.</p>
