<p>Alice stopped by a coffee shop three days in a row at a conference to buy drinks and pastries. On the first day, she bought a cup of coffee, a muffin and a scone for which she paid $6.15. The next day she bought two cups of coffee, three muffins and a scone (for herself and friends). Her bill was $12.20. The last day she bought a cup of coffee, two muffins and two scones, and paid $10.35. Determine the price of a cup of coffee, the price of a muffin and the price of a scone. Clearly explain your set-up for the problem. (Assume you are explaining your solution to someone who has not solved the problem herself/himself).</p>
