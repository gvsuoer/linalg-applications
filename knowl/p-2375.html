<p>Equation <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_3_c_1.html" title="Equation 14.1">(14.1)</a> illustrates that it would be convenient to view the action of <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> in the coordinate system where <span class="process-math">\(\Span\{\vv_1\}\)</span> serves as the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis and <span class="process-math">\(\Span\{\vv_2\}\)</span> as the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-axis. In this case, we can visualize that when we apply the transformation <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> to a vector <span class="process-math">\(\vb = c_1 \vv_1 + c_2 \vv_2\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> the result is an output vector is scaled by a factor of <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> in the <span class="process-math">\(\vv_1\)</span> direction and by a factor of <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> in the <span class="process-math">\(\vv_2\)</span> direction. For example, consider the box with vertices at <span class="process-math">\((0,0)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vv_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vv_2\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vv_1+\vv_2\)</span> as shown at left in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_3_c_1.html" title="Figure 14.1">Figure 14.1</a>. The transformation <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> stretches this box by a factor of <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> in the <span class="process-math">\(\vv_1\)</span> direction and a factor of <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> in the <span class="process-math">\(\vv_2\)</span> direction as illustrated at right in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_3_c_1.html" title="Figure 14.1">Figure 14.1</a>. In this situation, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors provide the most convenient perspective through which to visualize the action of the transformation <span class="process-math">\(T\text{.}\)</span> Here, <span class="process-math">\(\Span\{\vv_1\}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\Span\{\vv_2\}\)</span> are the eigenspaces of the matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span></p>
