<p>The GGH cryptosystem relies on the fact that we can convert “good” bases for lattices into “bad” bases. We will not delve into the details of what separates a “good” basis from a “bad” one, but suffice it to say that a good basis is one in which the basis vectors are close to being perpendicular<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-31-hidden.html" title="Footnote 31"><sup> 31 </sup></a> and are all short (that is, they have small norms), while any other basis is a bad basis. An example of a good basis is the basis <span class="process-math">\(S_1\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act_lattices_1.html" title="Project Activity 15.7">Project Activity 15.7</a>, and we will see later that <span class="process-math">\(\{[-2 \ 8]^{\tr}, [-1 \ 3]^{\tr}\}\)</span> is a bad basis for the same lattice. You should draw a picture of the vectors <span class="process-math">\([-2 \ 8]^{\tr}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\([-1 \ 3]^{\tr}\)</span> to convince yourself that this is a bad basis for its lattice.</p>
