<p>In problem (1) we should have noticed that a space can have more than one basis, but that any two bases contain the same number of elements. This is a critically important idea that we investigate in more detail in this problem in one specific case. Assume that <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> is a subspace of <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> that has a basis <span class="process-math">\(\B = \{\vv_1, \vv_2\}\)</span> with two basis vectors. We want to see if any other basis for <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> can have a different number of elements. Let us now consider a set <span class="process-math">\(U = \{\vu_1, \vu_2, \vu_3\}\)</span> of three vectors in <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span> Our goal is to determine if <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> can be a basis for <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(\B\)</span> is a basis for <span class="process-math">\(W\text{,}\)</span> any vector in <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> can be written as a linear combination of the vectors in <span class="process-math">\(\B\text{.}\)</span> So we can write</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align}
\vu_1 \amp = a_{11}\vv_1 + a_{21}\vv_2\tag{15.1}\\
\vu_2 \amp = a_{12}\vv_1 + a_{22}\vv_2\tag{15.2}\\
\vu_3 \amp = a_{13}\vv_1 + a_{23}\vv_2\tag{15.3}
\end{align}
</div>
<p class="continuation">for some scalars <span class="process-math">\(a_{ij}\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> were to be a basis for <span class="process-math">\(W\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> would have to be a linearly independent set. To determine the independence or dependence of <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> we consider the vector equation</p>
