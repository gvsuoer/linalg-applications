<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> be a matrix with <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> distinct eigenvalues <span class="process-math">\(\lambda_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\lambda_2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\ldots\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\lambda_k\)</span> and corresponding eigenvectors <span class="process-math">\(\vv_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vv_2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\ldots\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vv_k\text{.}\)</span> To understand why <span class="process-math">\(\vv_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vv_2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\ldots\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vv_k\)</span> are linearly independent, we will argue by contradiction and suppose that the vectors <span class="process-math">\(\vv_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vv_2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\ldots\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vv_k\)</span> are linearly dependent. Note that <span class="process-math">\(\vv_1\)</span> cannot be the zero vector (why?), so the set <span class="process-math">\(S_1=\{\vv_1\}\)</span> is linearly independent. If we include <span class="process-math">\(\vv_2\)</span> into this set, the set <span class="process-math">\(S_2 = \{\vv_1, \vv_2\}\)</span> may be linearly independent or dependent. If <span class="process-math">\(S_2\)</span> is linearly independent, then the set <span class="process-math">\(S_3 = \{\vv_1, \vv_2, \vv_3\}\)</span> may be linearly independent or dependent. We can continue adding additional vectors until we reach the set <span class="process-math">\(S_k = \{\vv_1, \vv_2, \vv_3, \ldots, \vv_k\}\)</span> which we are assuming is linearly dependent. So there must be a smallest integer <span class="process-math">\(m \geq 2\)</span> such that the set <span class="process-math">\(S_m\)</span> is linearly dependent while <span class="process-math">\(S_{m-1}\)</span> is linearly independent. Since <span class="process-math">\(S_m = \{\vv_1, \vv_2, \vv_3, \ldots, \vv_m\}\)</span> is linearly dependent, there is a linear combination of <span class="process-math">\(\vv_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vv_2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\ldots\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vv_m\)</span> with weights not all 0 that is the zero vector. Let <span class="process-math">\(c_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(c_2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\ldots\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(c_m\)</span> be such weights, not all zero, so that</p>
