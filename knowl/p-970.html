<p>Information is often contained in and conveyed through vectors â€” especially linear combinations of vectors. In this section we will investigate the concepts of linear dependence and independence of a set of vectors. Our goal is to be able to efficiently determine when a given set of vectors forms a <dfn class="terminology">minimal spanning set</dfn>. A minimal spanning set is a spanning set that contains the smallest number of vectors to obtain all of the vectors in the span. An important aspect of a minimal spanning set is that every vector in the span can be written in one and only one way as a linear combination of the vectors in the minimal spanning set. This will allow us to define the important notion of the dimension of a vector space.</p>
