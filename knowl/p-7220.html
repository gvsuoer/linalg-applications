<p>To see how the Bailey's model is constructed, we make some assumption. We split the population at any time into two groups, those infected with the disease, and those susceptible, i.e., not currently infected. We assume that once an individual is infected, that individual is always infected. A person catches the disease by interacting with an infected individual. That is, if a susceptible individual meets an infected individual, the chance that the susceptible person contracts the disease is <span class="process-math">\(\beta\)</span> (the <em class="emphasis">infection rate</em>). For example, there many be a <span class="process-math">\(5\%\)</span> chance that an encounter between a susceptible individual and an infected individual results in the susceptible individual contracting the disease. (Of course, there are many variables involved in such an interaction â€” if no one is wearing masks and the interaction involves close contact, the infection rate would be higher than if everyone practices social distancing. For the sake of simplicity, we assume one infection rate for the entire population.) With this simple model we assume assume homogeneous mixing in the population. That is, it is equally likely that any one individual will interact with any other in a given time frame. Let <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> be the number of susceptible individuals in the population at time <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span> Then the number of infected individuals is the total population minus <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(n+1-y\)</span> (recall that we introduced an infected individual into the population). So the change in the number of susceptible individuals in the population at time <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(-\beta y(n+1-y)\)</span> (since the <span class="process-math">\(n+1-y\)</span> susceptible individuals interact with the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> infected individuals). That is, <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dy}{ds} = -\beta y (n+1-y)\text{.}\)</span> Bailey makes the substitution of <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(\beta s\)</span> to simplify the equation. This substitution makes <span class="process-math">\(ds = \frac{1}{\beta} dt\text{,}\)</span> which produces the differential equation <span class="process-math">\(\beta \frac{dy}{dt} =  -\beta y (n+1-y)\text{.}\)</span> The <span class="process-math">\(\beta\)</span>s cancel, producing the differential equation</p>
