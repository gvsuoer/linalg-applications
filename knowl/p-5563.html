<p>We will consider wavelets as a tool for image compression. The basic idea behind using wavelets to compress images is that we start with a digital image, made up of pixels. Each pixel can be assigned a number or a vector (depending on the makeup of the image). The image can then be represented as a matrix (or a set of matrices) <span class="process-math">\(M\text{,}\)</span> where each entry in <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> represents a pixel in the image. As a simple example, consider the <span class="process-math">\(16 \times 16\)</span> image of a flower as shown at left in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_Flower_1.html" title="Figure 32.1">Figure 32.1</a>. (We will work with small images like this to make the calculations more manageable, but the ideas work for any size image. We could also extend our methods to consider color images, but for the sake of simplicity we focus on grayscale.)</p>
