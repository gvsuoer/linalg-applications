<p>More complicated and realistic shapes can be represented by piecing together two or more Bézier curves as illustrated with the letter “S” in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_Letter_S.html" title="Figure 6.1">Figure 6.1</a>. Suppose we have two cubic Bézier curves, the first with control points <span class="process-math">\(\vp_0\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vp_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vp_2\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vp_3\)</span> and the second with control points <span class="process-math">\(\vp_0'\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vp_1'\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vp_2'\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vp_3'\text{.}\)</span> You may have noticed that <span class="process-math">\(\vp_1\)</span> lies on the tangent line to the first Bézier curve at <span class="process-math">\(\vp_0\)</span> and that <span class="process-math">\(\vp_2\)</span> lies on the tangent line to the first Bézier curve at <span class="process-math">\(\vp_3\text{.}\)</span> (Play around with the program <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Cubic Bezier</code> to convince yourself of these statements. This can be proved in a straightforward manner using vector calculus.) So if we want to make a smooth curve from these two Bézier curves, the curves will need to join together smoothly at <span class="process-math">\(\vp_3\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vp_0'\text{.}\)</span> This will force <span class="process-math">\(\vp_3 = \vp_0'\)</span> and the tangents at <span class="process-math">\(\vp_3 = \vp_0'\)</span> will have to match. This implies that <span class="process-math">\(\vp_2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vp_3\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vp_1'\)</span> all have to lie on this common tangent line. Keeping this idea in mind, use the GeoGebra file <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Cubic Bezier Pair</code> at <a class="external" href="https://www.geogebra.org/m/UwxQ6RPk" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">geogebra.org/m/UwxQ6RPk</code></a> to find control points for the pair of Bézier curves that create your own letter S.</p>
