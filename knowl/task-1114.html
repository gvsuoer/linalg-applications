<p>In parts (a) and (b) you might have noticed that in some sense <span class="process-math">\(\vx_1\)</span> is closer to being an eigenvector of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> than <span class="process-math">\(\vx_0\)</span> was. So maybe continuing this process will get us closer to an eigenvector of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> In other words, for each positive integer <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> we define <span class="process-math">\(\vx_k\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(A \vx_{k-1}\text{.}\)</span> Before we proceed, however, we should note that as we calculate the vectors <span class="process-math">\(\vx_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vx_2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vx_3\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\ldots\text{,}\)</span> the entries in the vectors get large very quickly. So it will be useful to scale the entries so that they stay at a reasonable size, which makes it easier to interpret the output. One way to do this is to divide each vector <span class="process-math">\(\vx_i\)</span> by its largest component in absolute value so that all of the entries stay between <span class="process-math">\(-1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-38-hidden.html" title="Footnote 38"><sup> 38 </sup></a> So in our example we have <span class="process-math">\(\vx_0 = [1 \ 0]^{\tr}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vx_1 = [2/5 \ 1]^{\tr}\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vx_2 = [1 \ 25/34]^{\tr}\text{.}\)</span> Explain why scaling our vectors will not affect our search for an eigenvector.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="chap_approx_eigenvalues.html#task-1114" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
