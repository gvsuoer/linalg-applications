<p>Mathematicians look for patterns and for similarities between mathematical objects. In doing so, mathematicians often consider larger collections of objects that are sorted according to their similarities and then study these collections rather than just the objects themselves. This perspective can be very powerful — whatever can be shown to be true about an arbitrary element in a collection will then be true for every specific element in the collection. In this section we study the larger collection of sets that share the algebraic structure of vectors in <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{.}\)</span> These sets are called <dfn class="terminology">vector spaces</dfn>.</p>
