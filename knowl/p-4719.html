<p>This effect is a result in classical mechanics that describes the rotational movement of a rigid body in space, called the <dfn class="terminology">tennis racket effect</dfn> (or the Dzhanibekov effect, after the Russian cosmonaut Vladimir Dzhanibekov who discovered the theorem's consequences while in zero gravity in space — you can see an illustration of this in the video at <a class="external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2o9eBl_Gzw" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">youtube.com/watch?v=L2o9eBl_Gzw</code></a>). The result is simple to see in practice, but is difficult to intuitively understand why the behavior is different around the intermediate axis. There is a story of a student who asked the famous physicist Richard Feynman if there is any intuitive way to understand the result; Feynman supposedly went into deep thought for about 10 or 15 seconds and answered, “no.” As we will see later in this section, we can understand this effect using the principal axes of a rigid body.</p>
