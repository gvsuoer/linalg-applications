<p>There is an important and subtle point to consider here. When we use these operations to find a solution to a system of equations, we are assuming that the system has a solution. The application of these operations then tells us what a solution must look like. However, there is no guarantee that the outcome is actually a solution — to be safe we should check to make sure that our result is a solution to the system. In the case of linear systems, though, every one of our operations on equations is reversible (if applied correctly), so the result will always be a solution (but this is not true in general for non-linear systems).</p>
