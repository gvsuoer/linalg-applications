<p>We have encountered functions throughout our study of mathematics â€” we explore graphs of functions in algebra and differentiate and integrate functions in calculus. In linear algebra we have investigated special types of functions, e.g., matrix and coordinate transformations, that preserve the vector space structure. Any function that has the same properties as matrix and coordinate transformations is a <dfn class="terminology">linear transformation</dfn>. Linear transformations are important in linear algebra in that we can study similarities and connections between vector spaces by examining transformations between them. Linear transformations model or approximately model certain real-life processes (like discrete dynamical systems, geometrical transformations, Google PageRank, etc.). Also, we can determine the behavior of an entire linear transformation by knowing how it acts on just a basis.</p>
