<p>Alice stopped by a coffee shop two days in a row at a conference to buy drinks and pastries. On the first day, she bought a cup of coffee and two muffins for which she paid $6.87. The next day she bought two cups of coffee and three muffins (for herself and a friend). Her bill was $11.25. Use the method of elimination to determine the price of a cup of coffee, and the price of a muffin. Clearly explain your set-up for the problem. (Assume you are explaining your solution to someone who has not solved the problem herself/himself).</p>
