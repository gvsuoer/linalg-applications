<p>Each player has two knights to start the game, for one player the knights would begin in positions <span class="process-math">\((1,0)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((6,0)\text{.}\)</span> Because of the symmetry of the knight's moves, we will only analyze the moves of the knight that begins at position <span class="process-math">\((1,0)\text{.}\)</span> This knight has only three allowable moves from its starting point (assuming that the board is empty), as shown at right in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_knight_2.html" title="Figure 4.13">Figure 4.13</a>. The questions we will ask are: given any position on the board, can the knight move from its start position to that position using only knight moves and, what sequence of moves will make that happen. To answer these questions we will use linear combinations of knight moves described as vectors.</p>
