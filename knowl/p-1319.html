<p>Now we turn to multiplication of matrices. Our first goal is to find out what conditions we need on the sizes of matrices <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> if the matrix-matrix product <span class="process-math">\(AB\)</span> is defined and what the size of the resulting product matrix is. We know the condition and the size of the result in the special case of <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> being a vector, i.e., a matrix with one column. So our conjectures for the general case should match what we know in the special case. In each part of this problem, use any appropriate tool (e.g., your calculator, Maple, Mathematica, Wolfram<span class="process-math">\(|\)</span>Alpha) to determine the matrix product <span class="process-math">\(AB\text{,}\)</span> if it exists. If you obtain a product, write it down and explain how its size is related to the sizes of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> If you receive an error, write down the error and guess why the error occurred and/or what it means.</p>
