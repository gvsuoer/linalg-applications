<p>If <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> is a vector space with a basis <span class="process-math">\(\CB = \{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_n\}\text{,}\)</span> we have seen that the coordinate transformation <span class="process-math">\(T : V \to \R^n\)</span> defined by <span class="process-math">\(T(\vx) = [\vx]_{\CB}\)</span> is a linear transformation that is both one-to-one and onto. This allows us to uniquely identify any vector in <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> with a vector in <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> so that the vector space structure is preserved. In other words, the vector space <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> is for all intents and purposes the same as the vector space <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{,}\)</span> except for the way we represent the vectors. This is a very powerful idea in that it shows that any vector space of dimension <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is essentially the same as <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{.}\)</span> When this happens we say that the vectors spaces are <dfn class="terminology">isomorphic</dfn> and call the coordinate transformation an <dfn class="terminology">isomorphism</dfn>.</p>
