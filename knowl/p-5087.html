<p>We now need to understand how we can represent documents and terms in this smaller space where <span class="process-math">\(A_k = U_k \Sigma_k V_k^{\tr}\text{.}\)</span> Informally, we can consider the rows of <span class="process-math">\(U_k\)</span> as representing the coordinates of each term in the lower dimensional concept space and the columns of <span class="process-math">\(V_k^{\tr}\)</span> as the coordinates of the documents, while the entries of <span class="process-math">\(\Sigma_k\)</span> tell us how important each semantic dimension is. The dot product of two row vectors of <span class="process-math">\(A_k\)</span> indicates how terms compare across documents. This product is <span class="process-math">\(A_kA_k^{\tr}\text{.}\)</span> Just as in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act_LSI_ATA_AAT.html" title="Project Activity 29.7">Project Activity 29.7</a>, we have <span class="process-math">\(A_kA_k^{\tr} = \left(U_k \Sigma_k\right) \left(U_k\Sigma_k\right)^{\tr}\text{.}\)</span> In other words, if we consider the rows of <span class="process-math">\(U_k\Sigma_k\)</span> as coordinates for terms, then the dot products of these rows give us term to term comparisons. (Note that multiplying <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(\Sigma\)</span> just stretches the rows of <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> by the singular values according to the importance of the concept represented by that singular value.) Similarly, the dot product between columns of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> provide a comparison of documents. This comparison is given by <span class="process-math">\(A_k^{\tr}A_k^ = \left(V_k \Sigma_k^{\tr}\right) \left(V_k\Sigma_k^{\tr}\right)^{\tr}\)</span> (again by <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act_LSI_ATA_AAT.html" title="Project Activity 29.7">Project Activity 29.7</a>). So we can consider the rows of <span class="process-math">\(V\Sigma^{\tr}\)</span> as providing coordinates for documents.</p>
