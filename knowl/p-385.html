<p>In the previous sections we saw how to simplify a linear system and its matrix representation via the elimination method without changing the solution set. This process is more efficient when performed on the matrix representation rather than on the system itself. Furthermore, the process of applying row operations to any augmented matrix is one that can be automated. In order to write an algorithm that can be used with any size augmented matrix to the extent that it can be applied even by a computer program, it is necessary to have a consistent procedure and a stopping point for the simplification process. The two main properties that we want the simplified augmented matrix to satisfy are that it should be easy to see if the system has solutions from the simplified matrix, and in cases when there are solutions, the general form of the solutions can be easily found. Hence the topic of this section is to define the process of elimination completely and generally.</p>
