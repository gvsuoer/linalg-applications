<p>Notice that we are not actually calculating the vectors <span class="process-math">\(\vx_k\)</span> here — this is a theoretical argument and we don't know <span class="process-math">\(\lambda_1\)</span> and are not performing any scaling like we did in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/pa_4_d.html" title="Preview Activity 20.1">Preview Activity 20.1</a>. We are assuming that <span class="process-math">\(\lambda_1\)</span> is the dominant eigenvalue of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> though, so for each <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> the terms <span class="process-math">\(\left(\frac{\lambda_i}{\lambda_1}\right)^k\)</span> converge to <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> goes to infinity. Thus,</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/pa_4_d.html">

\vx_k \approx \lambda_1^k a_1 \vv_1

<p class="continuation">for large values of <span class="process-math">\(k\text{,}\)</span> which makes the sequence <span class="process-math">\(\{\vx_k\}\)</span> converge to a vector in the direction of a dominant eigenvector <span class="process-math">\(\vv_1\)</span> provided <span class="process-math">\(a_1 \neq 0\text{.}\)</span> So we need to be careful enough to choose a seed that has a nonzero component in the direction of <span class="process-math">\(\vv_1\text{.}\)</span> Of course, we generally don't know that our matrix is diagonalizable before we make these calculations, but for many matrices the sequence <span class="process-math">\(\{\vx_k\}\)</span> will approach a dominant eigenvector.</p>
