<p>Only some square matrices have inverses. However, every matrix has a pseudoinverse. A pseudoinverse <span class="process-math">\(A^{+}\)</span> of a matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> provides something like an inverse when a matrix doesn't have an inverse. Pseudoinverses are useful to approximate solutions to linear systems. If <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is invertible, then the equation <span class="process-math">\(A \vx = \vb\)</span> has the solution <span class="process-math">\(\vx = A^{-1}\vb\text{,}\)</span> but when <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is not invertible and <span class="process-math">\(\vb\)</span> is not in <span class="process-math">\(\Col A\text{,}\)</span> then the equation <span class="process-math">\(A \vx = \vb\)</span> has no solution. In the invertible case of an <span class="process-math">\(n \times n\)</span> matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> there is a matrix <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(AB = BA = I_n\text{.}\)</span> This also implies that <span class="process-math">\(BAB = B\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(ABA = A\text{.}\)</span> To mimic this situation when <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is not invertible, we search for a matrix <span class="process-math">\(A^+\)</span> (a pseudoinverse of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span>) so that <span class="process-math">\(AA^+A = A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(A^+AA^+ = A^+\text{,}\)</span> as we saw in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/pa_7_d_2.html" title="Preview Activity 30.7">Preview Activity 30.7</a>. Then it turns out that <span class="process-math">\(A^+\)</span> acts something like an inverse for <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> In this case, we approximate the solution to <span class="process-math">\(A \vx = \vb\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(\vx^* = A^+\vb\text{,}\)</span> and we will see that the vector <span class="process-math">\(A\vx^* = AA^+\vb\)</span> turns out to be the vector in <span class="process-math">\(\Col A\)</span> that is closest to <span class="process-math">\(\vb\)</span> in the least squares sense.</p>
