<p>Next we discuss the fatigue effect. Keeping a strong defense is an expensive and taxing enterprise, often exacting a heavy toll on the resources of a nation. For example, consider the fatigue that the U.S. experienced fighting wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, losing much hardware and manpower in these conflicts. Let <span class="process-math">\(\delta_{ii}\)</span> represent this <dfn class="terminology">fatigue factor</dfn> on nation <span class="process-math">\(i\text{.}\)</span> Think of <span class="process-math">\(\delta_{ii}\)</span> as a measure of how much the nation has to replace each year, so a positive fatigue factor means that the nation is adding to its armament. The fatigue factor produces an effect of <span class="process-math">\(\delta_{ii}a_i(n-1)\)</span> on the armament of nation <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> at time <span class="process-math">\(t=n\)</span> that is the effect of the armament at time <span class="process-math">\(t=n-1\text{.}\)</span></p>
