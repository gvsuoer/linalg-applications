<p>Suppose that there are three base stations <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> that can send and receive signals from your mobile phone. Assume that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is located at point <span class="process-math">\((-1,-2)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> at point <span class="process-math">\((36,5)\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> at point <span class="process-math">\((16,35)\text{.}\)</span> Also assume that your mobile phone location is point <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\text{.}\)</span> Based on the time that it takes to receive the signals from the three base stations, it can be determined that your distance to base station <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(28\)</span> km, your distance to base station <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(26\)</span> km, and your distance to base station <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(14\)</span> km using a coordinate system with measurements in kilometers based on a reference point chosen to be <span class="process-math">\((0,0)\text{.}\)</span> Due to limitations on the measurement equipment, these measurements all contain some unknown error which we will denote as <span class="process-math">\(z\text{.}\)</span> The goal is to determine your location in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> based on this information.</p>
