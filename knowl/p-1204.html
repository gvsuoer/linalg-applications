<p>Having a matrix transformation from <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\R^m\)</span> can tell us things about <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> For example, when a matrix transformation from <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\R^m\)</span> is one-to-one, it means that there is a unique input vector for every output vector. Since a matrix transformation preserves the algebraic structure of <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{,}\)</span> this implies that the collection of the images of the vectors in the domain of <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> form a copy of <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> inside of <span class="process-math">\(\R^m\text{.}\)</span> If we think of <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> as a one-to-one matrix transformation with <span class="process-math">\(T(\vx) = A \vx\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(m \times n\)</span> matrix, then every column of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> will have to be a pivot column. It follows that if there is a one-to-one matrix transformation from <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\R^m\text{,}\)</span> we must have <span class="process-math">\(m \geq n\text{.}\)</span> Similarly, if a matrix transformation <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\R^m\)</span> is onto, then for each <span class="process-math">\(\vb\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\R^m\text{,}\)</span> if we select one vector in the domain of <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> whose image is <span class="process-math">\(\vb\text{,}\)</span> then the collection of these vectors in the domain of <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is a copy of <span class="process-math">\(\R^m\)</span> inside of <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{.}\)</span> So if there is an onto matrix transformation from <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\R^m\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(n \geq m\text{.}\)</span> As a consequence, the only way a matrix transformation from <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\R^m\)</span> is both one-to-one and onto is if <span class="process-math">\(n = m\text{.}\)</span></p>
