<p>Wavelets are generated from the mother wavelet by scalings and translations. To further simplify our work we will restrict ourselves to wavelets on [0,1], although this is not necessary. The advantage the wavelets have over other methods of data analysis (Fourier analysis for example) is that with the scalings and translations we are able to analyze both frequency on large intervals and isolate signal discontinuities on very small intervals. The way this is done is by using a large collection (infinite, in fact) of basis functions with which to transform the data. We'll begin by looking at how these basis functions arise.</p>
