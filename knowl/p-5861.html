<p>We will use an example to illustrate important concepts we will need. To realistically apply PCA we will have much more data than this, but for now we will restrict ourselves to only two variables so that we can visualize our results. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/T_PCA_SAT_2.html" title="Table 33.7: SAT data">Table 33.7</a> presents information from ten states on two attributes related to the SAT — Evidence-Based Reading and Writing (EBRW) score and Math score. The SAT is made up of three sections: Reading, Writing and Language (also just called Writing), and Math. The The EBRW score is calculated by combining the Reading and Writing section scores — both the Math and EBRW are scored on a scale of 200-800.</p>
