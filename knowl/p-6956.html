<p>In the examples above, the only matrices where the algebraic and geometric multiplicities of the eigenvalue 2 are equal are the diagonal matrices, which obviously have eigenvalue decompositions. The existence of ones above the diagonal destroys this property. However, the positioning of the ones is also strategical. By letting ones above the diagonal determine how to split the matrix into diagonal blocks, we can categorize the matrices. For example, the matrix in part (c) has one big <span class="process-math">\(3\times 3\)</span> block with twos on the diagonal and ones above, while the matrix in part (d) as a <span class="process-math">\(2\times 2\)</span> block at the top left and another <span class="process-math">\(1\times 1\)</span> block at the bottom right. Determine the blocks for all matrices above, and identify the relationship between the number of blocks and the geometric multiplicity.</p>
