<p>We should also note that the definition of a vector space only states the existence of a zero vector and an additive inverse for each vector in the space, and does not say that there cannot be more than one zero vector or more than one additive inverse of a vector in the space. The reason why is that the uniqueness of the zero vector and an additive inverse of a vector can be proved from the defining properties of a vector space, and so we don't list this consequence as a defining property. Similarly, the defining properties of a vector space do not state that the additive inverse of a vector <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> is the scalar multiple <span class="process-math">\((-1)\vv\text{.}\)</span> Verification of these properties are left for the exercises. We summarize the results of this section in the following theorem.</p>
