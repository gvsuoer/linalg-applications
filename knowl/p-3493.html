<p>The Leslie model can be modified to consider harvesting. It is possible to harvest different age groups at different rates, and to harvest only some age groups and not others. In the case of sheep, it might make sense to only harvest from the youngest population since lamb is more desirable than mutton and the lamb population grows the fastest. Assume that this is our harvesting strategy and that we harvest our sheep from only the youngest age group at the start of each year. Let <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> be the fraction of sheep we harvest from the youngest age group each year after considering growth.</p>
