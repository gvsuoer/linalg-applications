<p>Around 1900 or so determinants were deemed much more important than they are today. In fact, determinants were used even before matrices. According to Tucker<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-33-hidden.html" title="Footnote 33"><sup> 33 </sup></a> determinants (not matrices) developed out of the study of coefficients of systems of linear equations and were used by Leibniz 150 years before the term matrix was coined by J. J. Sylvester in 1848. Even though determinants are not as important as they once were, the determinant of a matrix is still a useful quantity. We saw in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/pa_4_a.html" title="Preview Activity 17.1">Preview Activity 17.1</a> that the determinant of a matrix tells us if the matrix is invertible and how it can help us find eigenvalues. In this section, we will see how to find the determinant of any size matrix and how to use this determinant to find the eigenvalues.</p>
