<p>Some quadratic forms form equations in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> that are very familiar: <span class="process-math">\(x^2+y^2=1\)</span> is an equation of a circle, <span class="process-math">\(2x^2+3y^2=2\)</span> is an equation of an ellipse, and <span class="process-math">\(x^2-y^2=1\)</span> is an equation of a hyperbola. Of course, these do not represent all of the quadratic forms in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> — some contain cross-product terms. We can recognize the equations above because they contain no cross-product terms (terms involving <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span>). We can more easily recognize the quadratic forms that contain cross-product terms if  we can somehow rewrite the forms in a different format with no cross-product terms. We illustrate how this can be done with the quadratic form <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> defined by <span class="process-math">\(Q(\vx) = x^2-xy+y^2\text{.}\)</span></p>
