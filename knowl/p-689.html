<p>We add two vectors of the same size by adding corresponding components. In other words, if <span class="process-math">\(\vu\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> are vectors of the same size and <span class="process-math">\(u_i\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v_i\)</span> are the <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> components of <span class="process-math">\(\vu\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vv\text{,}\)</span> respectively, then <span class="process-math">\(\vu +\vv\)</span> is the vector whose <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span>th component is <span class="process-math">\(u_i+v_i\)</span> for each <span class="process-math">\(i\text{.}\)</span> Geometrically, we represent the sum of two vectors using the Parallelogram Rule: The vector <span class="process-math">\(\vu+\vv\)</span> is the directed line segment from the origin to the 4th point of the parallelogram formed by the origin and the vectors <span class="process-math">\(\vu, \vv\text{.}\)</span></p>
