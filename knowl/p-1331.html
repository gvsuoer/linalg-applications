<p>As we have done each time we have introduced a new operation, we ask what properties the operation has. For example, you determined in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/pa_2_a.html" title="Preview Activity 8.1">Preview ActivityÂ 8.1</a> that addition of matrices is a commutative operation. More specifically, for every two <span class="process-math">\(m\times n\)</span> matrices <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(A+B=B+A\text{.}\)</span> We can use similar arguments to verify the following properties of matrix addition and multiplication by scalars. Notice that these properties are very similar to the properties of addition and scalar multiplication of vectors we discussed earlier. This should come as no surprise since the <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-dimensional vectors are <span class="process-math">\(n\times 1\)</span> matrices. In a strange twist, we will see that matrices themselves can be considered as vectors when we discuss vector spaces in a later section.</p>
