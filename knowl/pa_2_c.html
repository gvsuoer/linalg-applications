<div class="introduction">
<p>Before we define the inverse matrix, recall that the identity matrix <span class="process-math">\(I_n\)</span> (with 1's along the diagonal and 0's everywhere else) is a multiplicative identity in the set of <span class="process-math">\(n \times n\)</span> matrices (just like the real number 1 is the multiplicative identity in the set of real number). In particular, <span class="process-math">\(I_nA = AI_n = A\)</span> for any <span class="process-math">\(n \times n\)</span> matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> Now we can generalize the inverse operation to matrices. For an <span class="process-math">\(n\times n\)</span> matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> we define <span class="process-math">\(A^{-1}\)</span> to be the matrix which when multiplied by <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> gives us the identity matrix. In other words, <span class="process-math">\(AA^{-1}=A^{-1}A=I_n\text{.}\)</span> We can find the inverse of a matrix in a calculator by using the <span class="process-math">\(x^{-1}\)</span> button.</p>
<p>For each of the following matrices, determine if the inverse exists using your calculator or other appropriate technology. If the inverse does exist, write down the inverse and check that it satisfies the defining property of the inverse matrix, that is <span class="process-math">\(AA^{-1}=A^{-1}A=I_n\text{.}\)</span> If the inverse doesn't exist, write down any error you received from the technology. Can you guess why the inverse does not exist for these matrices?</p>

<div class="introduction"><p>Now we turn to the question of how to find the inverse of a matrix in general. With this approach, we will be able to determine which matrices have inverses as well. We will consider the <span class="process-math">\(2 \times 2\)</span> case to make the calculations easier. Suppose <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is a <span class="process-math">\(2 \times 2\)</span> matrix. Our goal is to find a matrix <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(AB = I_2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(BA = I_2\text{.}\)</span> If such a matrix exists, we will call <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> the inverse, <span class="process-math">\(A^{-1}\text{,}\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span></p></div>

<div class="introduction"><p>A matrix inverse is extremely useful in solving matrix equations and can help us in solving systems of equations.

For example, <span class="process-math">\(A^{-1}AB=B\)</span> while we cannot simplify <span class="process-math">\(ABA^{-1}\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> unless <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> commute.)</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(B)</span></h6>
