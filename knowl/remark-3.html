<p>Compare the row echelon form of an augmented matrix to the corresponding system. Do you clearly see the correspondence between the requirements of the row echelon form and the properly eliminated variables in the system? Can you quickly come up with a system which will be in row echelon form when represented in augmented matrix form? Can you modify the standard row echelon form definition to cover cases where the elimination process eliminates the variables from last to first? For example, in a system with three equations in three unknowns, the last variable, say <span class="process-math">\(x_3\text{,}\)</span> can be eliminated from the second equation, and the last two variables, say <span class="process-math">\(x_2, x_3\)</span> can be eliminated from the last equation. How would you define this modified row echelon form for a general system with this modified elimination process?</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="chap_row_echelon_forms.html#remark-3" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
