<div class="introduction">
<p>To model the system of balls in bins we need to understand how the system can transform from one state to another. It suffices to count the number of balls in Bin 1 (since the remaining balls will be in Bin 2). Even though the balls are labeled, our count only cares about how many balls are in each bin. Let <span class="process-math">\(\vx_0 = [x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4]^{\tr}\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(x_i\)</span> is the probability that Bin 1 contains <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> balls, and let <span class="process-math">\(\vx_1 = \left[ x_0^1, x_1^1, x_2^1, x_3^1, x_4^1 \right]^{\tr}\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(x_i^1\)</span> is the probability that Bin 1 contains <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> balls after the first move. We will call the vectors <span class="process-math">\(\vx_0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vx_1\)</span> <dfn class="terminology">probability distributions</dfn> of balls in bins. Note that since all four balls have to be placed in some bin, the sum of the entries in our probability distribution vectors must be <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span> Recall that a move is an instance when a ball changes bins. We want to understand how <span class="process-math">\(\vx_1\)</span> is obtained from <span class="process-math">\(\vx_0\text{.}\)</span> In other words, we want to figure out what the probability that Bin 1 contains 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 balls after one ball changes bins if our initial probability distribution of balls in bins is <span class="process-math">\(\vx_0\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>We begin by analyzing the ways that a state can change. For example,</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Suppose there are <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> balls in Bin 1. (In our probability distribution <span class="process-math">\(\vx_0\text{,}\)</span> this happens with probability <span class="process-math">\(x_0\text{.}\)</span>) Then there are four balls in Bin 2. The only way for a ball to change bins is if one of the four balls moves from Bin 2 to Bin 1, putting us in State 1. Regardless of which ball moves, we will always be put in State 1, so this happens with a probability of <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span> In other words, if the probability that Bin 1 contains <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> balls is <span class="process-math">\(x_0\text{,}\)</span> then there is a probability of <span class="process-math">\((1)x_0\)</span> that Bin 1 will contain 1 ball after the move.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Suppose we have 1 ball in Bin 1. There are four ways this can happen (since there are four balls, and the one in Bin 1 is selected at random from the four balls), so the probability of a given ball being in Bin 1 is <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{4}\text{.}\)</span></p>
<ul class="circle">
<li><p>If the ball in Bin 1 moves, that move puts us in State <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span> In other words, if the probability that Bin 1 contains 1 ball is <span class="process-math">\(x_1\text{,}\)</span> then there is a probability of <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{4}x_1\)</span> that Bin 1 will contain <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> balls after a move.</p></li>
<li><p>If any of the <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> balls in Bin 2 moves (each moves with probability <span class="process-math">\(\frac{3}{4}\)</span>), that move puts us in State 2. In other words, if the probability that Bin 1 contains 1 ball is <span class="process-math">\(x_1\text{,}\)</span> then there is a probability of <span class="process-math">\(\frac{3}{4}x_1\)</span> that Bin 1 will contain <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> balls after a move.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
