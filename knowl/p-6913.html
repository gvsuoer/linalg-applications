<p>Part (a) shows that there are at least two different functions in <span class="process-math">\(E_{-c}\text{.}\)</span> To solve a differential equation is to find all of the solutions to the differential equation. In other words, we want to completely determine the eigenspace <span class="process-math">\(E_{-c}\text{.}\)</span> We have already seen that any function <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> of the form <span class="process-math">\(y(t) = c_1 \cos(t) + c_2 \sin(t)\)</span> is a solution to the differential equation <span class="process-math">\(mD^2(y) = -ky\text{.}\)</span> The theory of linear differential equations tells us that there is a unique solution to <span class="process-math">\(mD^2(y) = -ky\)</span> if we specify two initial conditions. What this means is that to show that any solution <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> to the differential equation <span class="process-math">\(mD^2(y) = -ky\)</span> with two initial values <span class="process-math">\(z(t_0)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(z'(t_0)\)</span> for some scalar <span class="process-math">\(t_0\)</span> is of the form <span class="process-math">\(y = c_1 \cos(t) + c_2 \sin(t)\text{,}\)</span> we need to verify that there are values of <span class="process-math">\(c_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c_2\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(y(t_0) = z(t_0)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y'(t_0) = z'(t_0)\text{.}\)</span> Here we will use this idea to show that any function in <span class="process-math">\(E_{-c}\)</span> is a linear combination of <span class="process-math">\(\cos(t)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\sin(t)\text{.}\)</span> That is, that the set <span class="process-math">\(\{\cos, \sin\}\)</span> spans <span class="process-math">\(E_{-c}\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(y = c_1 \cos(t) + c_2 \sin(t)\text{.}\)</span> Show that there are values for <span class="process-math">\(c_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c_2\)</span> such that</p>

<p class="continuation">This result, along with part(b), shows that <span class="process-math">\(\{\cos, \sin\}\)</span> is a basis for <span class="process-math">\(E_{-c}\text{.}\)</span> (Note: That the solutions to differential equation <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_de_Hooke.html" title="Equation 39.3">(39.3)</a> involve sines and cosines models the situation that a mass hanging from a spring will oscillate up and down.)</p>
