<p>In many situations (least squares approximations, for example) want to find a vector <span class="process-math">\(\vw\)</span> in a subspace <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> that is the “best” approximation to a vector <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> not in the subspace. A natural measure of “best” is to find a vector <span class="process-math">\(\vw\)</span>in <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> if one exists, such that the distance from <span class="process-math">\(\vw\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\vu\)</span> is a minimum. This means we want to find <span class="process-math">\(\vw\)</span> so that the quantity</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
||\vw - \vu ||
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">is as small as possible over all vectors <span class="process-math">\(\vw\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> To do this, we will need to find a suitable projection of the vector <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> onto the subspace <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> We have already done this in the case that <span class="process-math">\(W = \Span\{\vw_1\}\)</span> is the span of a single vector -- we can project the vector <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> in the direction of <span class="process-math">\(\vw_1\text{.}\)</span> Our goal is to generalize this to project a vector <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> onto an entire subspace in a useful way.</p>
