<p>Worked examples are included in each section. Part of the philosophy of this text is that students will develop the tools and understanding they need to work homework assignments through the preview, in-class activities, and class discussions. But some students express a desire for fully-worked examples in the text to reference during homework. In order to preserve the flow of material within a section, we include worked examples at the end of each section.</p>
