<p>We will algebraically represent a vector as a matrix with one column. For example, <span class="process-math">\(\vv = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1\\ 2 \end{array} \right]\)</span> is a vector with 2 entries, and we say that <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> is a vector in 2-space. By 2-space we mean <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\text{,}\)</span> which can be geometrically modeled as the plane. Here the symbol <span class="process-math">\(\R\)</span> indicates that the entries of <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> are real numbers and the superscript 2 tells us that <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> has two entries. Similarly, vectors in <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\)</span> have three entries, e.g., <span class="process-math">\(\left[ \begin{array}{r} 1\\ 3\\ -1 \end{array} \right]\text{.}\)</span> The collection of column vectors with three entries can be geometrically modeled as three-dimensional space. If a vector <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> has <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> entries we say that <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> is a vector in <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> (or <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-space). Vectors are also often indicated with arrows, so we might also see a vector <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> written as <span class="process-math">\(\overrightarrow{v}\text{.}\)</span> It is important when writing to differentiate between a vector <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> and a scalar <span class="process-math">\(v\text{.}\)</span> These are quite different objects and it is up to us to make sure we are clear what a symbol represents. We will use boldface letters to represent vectors.</p>
