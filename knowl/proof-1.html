<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(s = \{ \vv_1, \vv_2, \cdots, \vv_k \}\)</span> be a set of vectors in <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{.}\)</span> We will begin by verifying the first statement.</p>
<p>We assume that <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is a linearly dependent set and show that at least one vector in <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is a linear combination of the others. Since <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is linearly dependent, there are scalarc <span class="process-math">\(x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n\text{,}\)</span> not all of which are 0, so that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/eq_1_f_dependence_1.html">
\begin{equation}
x_1\vv_1 + x_2\vv_2 + \cdots +  x_{k}\vv_{k} = \vzero\text{.}\tag{6.3}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p class="continuation">We don't know which scalar(s) are not zero, but there is at least one. So let us assume that <span class="process-math">\(x_i\)</span> is not zero for some <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> between 1 and <span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span> we can then subtract <span class="process-math">\(x_i \vv_i\)</span> from both sides of Equation <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_1_f_dependence_1.html" title="Equation 6.3">(6.3)</a> and divide by <span class="process-math">\(x_i\)</span> to obtain</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/eq_1_f_dependence_1.html">
\begin{equation*}
\vv_i = \frac{x_1}{x_i}\vv_1 + \frac{x_2}{x_i}\vv_2 + \cdots + \frac{x_{i-1}}{x_i}\vv_{i-1} +  \frac{x_{i+1}}{x_i}\vv_{i+1} + \frac{x_{i+2}}{x_i}\vv_{i+2} + \cdots + \frac{x_{k}}{x_i}\vv_{k}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Thus, the vector <span class="process-math">\(\vv_i\)</span> is a linear combination of <span class="process-math">\(\vv_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vv_2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\cdots\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vv_{i-1}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vv_{i+1}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\cdots\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vv_k\text{,}\)</span> and at least one of the vectors in <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span>is a linear combination of the other vectors in <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>To verify the second statement, we assume that at least one of the vectors in <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> can be written as a linear combination of the others and show that <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is then a linearly dependent set. We don't know which vector(s) in <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> can be written as a linear combination of the others, but there is at least one. Let us suppose that <span class="process-math">\(\vv_i\)</span> is a linear combination of the others, but there is at least one. Let us suppose that <span class="process-math">\(\vv_i\)</span> is a linear combination of the vectors <span class="process-math">\(\vv_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vv_2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\cdots\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vv_{i-1}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vv_{i+1}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\cdots\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vv_k\text{,}\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> between 1 and <span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span> Then there exist scalars <span class="process-math">\(x_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x_2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\cdots\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x_{i-1}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x_{i+1}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\cdots\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x_n\)</span> so that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\vv_i = x_1\vv_1 + x_2\vv_2 + \cdots + x_{i-1}\vv_{i-1} +  x_{i+1}\vv_{i+1} + x_{i+2}\vv_{i+2} + \cdots + x_{k}\vv_{k}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">It follows that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\vzero = x_1\vv_1 + x_2\vv_2 + \cdots + x_{i-1}\vv_{i-1} +  (-1)\vv_i + x_{i+1}\vv_{i+1} + x_{i+2}\vv_{i+2} + \cdots + x_{k}\vv_{k}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">So there are scalars <span class="process-math">\(x_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x_2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\cdots\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x_n\)</span> (with <span class="process-math">\(x_i = -1\)</span>), not all of which are 0, so that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
x_1\vv_1 + x_2\vv_2 + \cdots +  x_{k}\vv_{k} = \vzero\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">This makes <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> a linearly dependent set.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="chap_independence.html#proof-1" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
