<p>Bézier curves are simple curves that were first developed in 1959 by French mathematician Paul de Casteljau, who was working at the French automaker Citroën. The curves were made public in 1962 by Pierre Bézier who used them in his work designing automobiles at the French car maker Renault. In addition to automobile design, Bézier curves have many other uses. Two of the most common applications of Bézier curves are font design and drawing tools. As an example, the letter “S” in Palatino font is shown using Bézier curves in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_Letter_S.html" title="Figure 6.1">Figure 6.1</a>. If you've used Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Macromedia Freehand, Fontographer, or any other of a number of drawing programs, then you've used Bézier curves. At the end of this section we will see how Bézier curves can be defined using linearly independent vectors and linear combinations of vectors.</p>
