<p>The standard algorithm for calculating a matrix product of two <span class="process-math">\(n \times n\)</span> matrices requires <span class="process-math">\(n^3\)</span> multiplications and a number of additions. Since additions are much less costly in terms of operations, the standard matrix product is <span class="process-math">\(O{\left(n^3\right)}\text{.}\)</span> We won't show it here, but using Strassen's algorithm on a product of <span class="process-math">\(2^m \times 2^m\)</span> matrices is <span class="process-math">\(O{\left(n^{\log_2(7)}\right)}\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(n = 2^m\text{.}\)</span> That means that Strassen's algorithm applied to an <span class="process-math">\(n \times n\)</span> matrix (where <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is a power of <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span>) requires approximately <span class="process-math">\(n^{\log_2(7)}\)</span> multiplications. We use this to analyze situations to determine when Strassen's algorithm is computationally more efficient than the standard algorithm.</p>
