<p>To rank how “important” a website is, we need to make some assumptions. We assume that a person visits a page and then surfs the web by selecting a link from that page — all links on a given page are assigned the same probability of being chosen. As an example, assume a small set of seven pages 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 with links between the pages given by the arrows as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_seven_page.html" title="Figure 9.5">Figure 9.5</a>.<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-19-hidden.html" title="Footnote 19"><sup> 19 </sup></a> So, for example, there is a hyperlink from page 4 to page 3, but no hyperlink in the opposite direction. If a web surfer starts on page 5, then there is probability of <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> that this person will surf to page 6 and a probability of <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> that the surfer will move to page 4. If there is no link leaving a page, as in the case of page 3, then the probability of remaining there is 1.</p>
