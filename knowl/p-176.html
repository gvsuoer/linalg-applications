<p>The source creates a charge that produces potential energy <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> measured in volts (V). No substance conducts electricity perfectly, there is always some price to pay (energy loss) to moving electricity. Electrical current <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> in amperes (A) is the flow of the electric charge in the circuit. (A current of 1 ampere means that <span class="process-math">\(6.2 \times 10^{18}\)</span> electrons pass through the circuit per second.) Current flows out of the positive terminal of a source and runs through each branch of the circuit. Let <span class="process-math">\(I_1\)</span> be the current flowing through the upper branch, <span class="process-math">\(I_2\)</span> the current through middle branch, and <span class="process-math">\(I_3\)</span> the current through the lower branch as illustrated in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_circuit1.html" title="Figure 1.1">Figure 1.1</a>. The goal is to find the current flowing in each branch of the circuit.</p>
