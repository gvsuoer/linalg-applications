<p>Another way (illustrated in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act_5_b_2_b.html" title="Activity 32.4">Activity 32.4</a>) to find a basis for <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> is to start with a spanning set <span class="process-math">\(\CS_1\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(\CS_1\)</span> is linearly independent, then <span class="process-math">\(\CS_1\)</span> is a basis for <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(\CS_1\)</span> is linearly dependent, then one vector in <span class="process-math">\(\CS_1\)</span> is a linear combination of the others and we can remove that vector to obtain a new set <span class="process-math">\(\CS_2\)</span> that also spans <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(\CS_2\)</span> is linearly independent, then <span class="process-math">\(\CS_2\)</span> is a basis for <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span> If not, we repeat the process as many times as needed until we arrive until at a subset <span class="process-math">\(\CS_k\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(\CS_1\)</span> that is linearly independent and spans <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span> We summarize these results in the following theorem.</p>
