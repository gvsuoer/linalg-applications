<p>To work with a closed model, we use an example (from <span class="booktitle">Input-Output Economics</span> by Wassily Leontief). Assume a simple three-sector economy consisting of agriculture (growing wheat), manufacturing (producing cloth), and households (supplying labor). Each sector of the economy relies on goods from the other sectors to operate (e.g., people must eat to work and need to be clothed). To model the interactions between the sectors, we consider how many units of product is needed as input from one sector to another to produce one unit of product in the second sector. For example, assume the following:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>to produce one unit (say dollars worth) of agricultural goods requires 25% of a unit of agricultural output, 28% of a unit of manufacturing output, and 27% of a unit of household output;</p></li>
<li><p>to produce one unit of manufactured goods requires 20% of a unit of agricultural output, 60% of a unit of manufacturing output, and 60% of a unit of household output;</p></li>
<li><p>to produce one unit of household goods requires 55% of a unit of agricultural output, 12% of a unit of manufacturing output, and 13% of a unit of household output.</p></li>
</ul>
