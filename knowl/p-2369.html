<p>According to the   Michigan Department of Technology, Management, and Budget, from 2011 to 2012, approximately 0.05% of the U.S. population outside of Michigan moved to the state of Michigan, while approximately 2% of Michigan's population moved out of Michigan. A reasonable question to ask about this situation is, if these numbers don't change, what is the long-term distribution of the US population inside and outside of Michigan (under the assumption that the total US population doesn't change.). The answer to this question involves eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix. More details can be found later in this section.</p>
