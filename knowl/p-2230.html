<p>When confronted with a subspace of <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{,}\)</span> we will usually want to find a minimal spanning set — a smallest spanning set — for the space. Recall that a minimal spanning set is also called a basis for the space. So a basis for a space must span that space, and to be a minimal spanning set we have seen that a basis must also be linearly independent. So to prove that a set is a basis for a subspace of <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> we need to demonstrate two things: that the set is linearly independent, and that the set spans the subspace.</p>
