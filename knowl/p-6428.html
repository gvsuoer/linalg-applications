<p>Simpson's rule is a reasonably accurate method for approximating definite integrals since it models the integrand on subintervals with quadratics. For that reason, Simpson's rule provides exact values for integrals of all polynomials of degree less than or equal to 2. In Gaussian quadrature, we will use a family of polynomials to determine points at which to evaluate an integral of the form <span class="process-math">\(\int_{-1}^1 f(t) \ dt\text{.}\)</span> By allowing ourselves to select evaluation points that are not uniformly distributed across the interval of integration, we will be able to approximate our integrals much more efficiently. The method is constructed so as to obtain exact values for as large of degree polynomial integrands as possible. As a result, if we can approximate our integrand well with polynomials, we can obtain very good approximations with Gaussian quadrature with minimal effort.</p>
