<p>A basis provides a system in which we can uniquely represent every vector in the space we are considering. More specifically, every vector in the space can be expressed as a linear combination of the vectors in the basis in a unique way. In order to be able to cover every point in the space, the basis has to span the space. In order to be able to provide a unique coordinate for each point, there should not be any extra vectors in the basis, which is achieved by linear independence of the vectors. For practical reasons, a basis simplifies many problems because we only need to solve the problem for each of the basis vectors. Solutions of the other cases usually follow because every vector in the space can be expressed as a unique linear combination of the basis vectors.</p>
