<p>Between each transmit antenna and each receiver antenna is a fading channel. The MIMO system is the collection of fading channels. If we let <span class="process-math">\(h_{ij}\)</span> be the fading between the <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span>th transmitter and <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span>th receiver, then we can represent this multipath fading as an <span class="process-math">\(m \times k\)</span> matrix <span class="process-math">\(H = [h_{ij}]\text{.}\)</span> We assume that there is also some noise in the received signal that we represent by <span class="process-math">\(n_j\)</span> (for the <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span>th receiving antenna). Our MIMO system is then represented as the matrix-vector equation</p>
