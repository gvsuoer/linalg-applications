<p>To understand the tennis racket effect, we are interested in rigid bodies as they move through space. Any rigid body in three space has three principal axes about which it likes to spin. These axes are at right angles to each other and pass through the center of mass. Think of enclosing the object in an ellipsoid — the longest axis is the <dfn class="terminology">primary</dfn> axis, the middle axis is the <dfn class="terminology">intermediate</dfn> axis, and the third axis is the third axis. As a rigid body moves through space, it rotates around these axes and there is inertia along each axis. Just like with a tennis racket, if you were to imagine an axle along any of the principal axes and spin the object along that axel, it will either rotate happily with no odd behavior like flipping, or it won't. The former behavior is that of a stable axis and the latter an unstable axis. The Tennis Racket Theorem is a statement about the rotation of the body. Essentially, the Tennis Racket Theorem states that the rotation of a rigid object around its primary and third principal axes is stable, while rotation around its intermediate axis is not. To understand why this is so, we need to return to moments of inertia.</p>
