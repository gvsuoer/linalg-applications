<p>As you might have noticed, systems with all the constants being 0 are special in that they always have a solution. (Why?) So we might consider grouping systems into two types: Those of the form <span class="process-math">\(A \vx = \vb\text{,}\)</span> where not all of the entries of the vector <span class="process-math">\(\vb\)</span> are <span class="process-math">\(0\text{,}\)</span> and those of the form <span class="process-math">\(A \vx = \vzero\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(\vzero\)</span> is the vector of all zeros. Systems like <span class="process-math">\(A \vx = \vb\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(\vb\)</span> contains at least one non-zero entry, are called <dfn class="terminology">nonhomogeneous</dfn> systems, and systems of the form <span class="process-math">\(A \vx = \vzero\)</span> are called <dfn class="terminology">homogeneous</dfn> systems. For every nonhomogeneous system <span class="process-math">\(A \vx = \vb\)</span> there is a corresponding homogeneous system <span class="process-math">\(A \vx = \vzero\text{,}\)</span> and there is a useful connection between the solutions to the nonhomogeneous system and the corresponding homogeneous system. For example, consider the nonhomogeneous system</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
A \vx = \vb
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">with</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation}
A = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} 1 \amp  1 \amp  2  \\ 1 \amp  2 \amp  1 \end{array}  \right], \ \vx = \left[ \begin{array}{c} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{array}  \right], \ \text{ and }  \ \vb =  \left[ \begin{array}{r} 0 \\ -2 \end{array}  \right]\text{.}\tag{5.2}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p class="continuation">The augmented matrix representation of this system is <span class="process-math">\([A \ | \ \vb]\text{.}\)</span> If we reduce this augmented matrix, we find</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\left[ \begin{array}{ccr|r} 1 \amp  0 \amp  3 \amp  2 \\ 0 \amp  1 \amp  -1 \amp  -2 \end{array}  \right]\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">From this RREF, we immediately see that the general solution is that <span class="process-math">\(x_3\)</span> is free, <span class="process-math">\(x_2 = x_3-2\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_1 = 2-3x_3\text{.}\)</span> In vector form, we can represent this general solution as</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation}
\left[ \begin{array}{c} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{array}  \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 2-3x_3 \\ x_3-2 \\ x_3 \end{array}  \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{r} 2 \\ -2 \\ 0 \end{array}  \right] + x_3\left[ \begin{array}{r} -3 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{array}  \right]\text{.}\tag{5.3}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p class="continuation">The rightmost expression above is called the <dfn class="terminology">parametric vector form</dfn> of the solution. If we had a system where the general solution involved more than one free variable, then we would write the parametric vector form to include one vector multiplying each free variable. For example, if the general solution of a system were that <span class="process-math">\(x_2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_3\)</span> are free and <span class="process-math">\(x_1=2+x_2+3x_3\text{,}\)</span> then the parametric vector form would be</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\vx = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 2+ x_2+3x_3 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{array}  \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 2 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{array}  \right] + x_2 \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{array}  \right] + x_3 \left[ \begin{array}{c} 3 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{array}  \right] \,\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Note that the parametric vector form expresses the solutions as a linear combination of a number of vectors, depending on the number of free variables, with an added constant vector. This expression helps us in interpreting the solution set geometrically, as we will see in this section.</p>
