<p>When we consider equations of the form <span class="process-math">\(Q(\vx) = d\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is a quadratic form in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> is a constant, we wind up with old friends like <span class="process-math">\(x^2+y^2=1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(2x^2+3y^2=2\text{,}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(x^2-y^2=1\text{.}\)</span> As we saw in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/pa_7_b.html" title="Preview Activity 28.1">Preview Activity 28.1</a> these equations are relatively easy to recognize. However, when we have cross-product terms, like in <span class="process-math">\(x^2-xy+y^2=1\text{,}\)</span> it is not so easy to identify the curve the equation represents. If there was a way to eliminate the cross-product term <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span> from this form, we might be more easily able to recognize its graph. The discussion in this section will focus on quadratic forms in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\text{,}\)</span> but we will see later that the arguments work in any number of dimensions. While working in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> we will use the standard variables <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> instead of <span class="process-math">\(x_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_2\text{.}\)</span></p>
