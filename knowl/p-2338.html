<p>If we think about the game as played on a <span class="process-math">\(25 \times 1\)</span> board, then pressing a square correlates to selecting one of the 25 components of a configuration vector. Each time we press a square, we make a move that changes the status of that square and all the squares vertically or horizontally adjacent to it from the <span class="process-math">\(5 \times 5\)</span> board. Recalling that adding 1 to a square has the effect of changing its status (from on to off or off to on), and each move that we make in the game can be represented as a <span class="process-math">\(25 \times 1\)</span> vector that is added to a configuration. For example, the move of pressing the first square is given by adding the vector</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\vm_{1} = [ 1 \ 1 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 1 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0\  0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 ]^{\tr}
