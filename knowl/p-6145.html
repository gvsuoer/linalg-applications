<p>We have seen, e.g., linear regression to fit a line to a set of data, that we often want to find a vector in a subspace that “best” approximates a given vector in a vector space. As in <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{,}\)</span> the projection of a vector onto a subspace has this important property. That is, <span class="process-math">\(\proj_W \vv\)</span> is the vector in <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> closest to <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> and therefore the best approximation of <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> by a vector in <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span> To see that this is true in any inner product space, we first need a generalization of the Pythagorean Theorem that holds in inner product spaces.</p>
