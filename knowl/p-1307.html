<p>This product involves eight scalar multiplications and some scalar additions. As we will see, multiplication is more computationally expensive than addition, so we will focus on multiplication. In 1969, a German mathematician named Volker Strassen showed<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-13-hidden.html" title="Footnote 13"><sup> 13 </sup></a> that the product of two <span class="process-math">\(2 \times 2\)</span> matrices can be calculated using only seven multiplications. While this is not much of an improvement, the Strassen algorithm can be applied to larger matrices, using matrix partitions (which allow for parallel computation), and its publication led to additional research on faster algorithms for matrix multiplication. More details are provided later in this section.</p>
