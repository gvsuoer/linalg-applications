<p>We have defined the coordinate vector of a vector <span class="process-math">\(\vx\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> with respect to a basis <span class="process-math">\(\CB = \{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_n\}\)</span> as the vector <span class="process-math">\([x_1 \ x_2 \ \ldots \ x_n]^{\tr}\)</span> if</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\vx = x_1 \vv_1 + x_2 \vv_2 + \cdots + x_n \vv_n\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Until now we have listed a basis as a set without regard to the order in which the basis elements are written. That is, the set <span class="process-math">\(\{\vv_1, \vv_2\}\)</span> is the same as the set <span class="process-math">\(\{\vv_2, \vv_1\}\text{.}\)</span> Notice, however, that if we change the order of the vectors in our basis, say from <span class="process-math">\(\{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_n\}\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\{\vv_2, \vv_1, \vv_3, \ldots, \vv_n\}\text{,}\)</span> then the coordinate vector of <span class="process-math">\(\vx\)</span> with respect to <span class="process-math">\(\CB\)</span> will be different. To avoid this problem, when discussing coordinate vectors we will consider our bases to be <em class="emphasis">ordered bases</em>, so that the order in which we write the elements in our basis is fixed. So, for example, the ordered basis <span class="process-math">\(\{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_n\}\)</span> is different than the ordered basis <span class="process-math">\(\{\vv_2, \vv_1, \vv_3, \ldots, \vv_n\}\text{.}\)</span></p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="chap_coordinate_vectors.html#paragraphs-24" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
