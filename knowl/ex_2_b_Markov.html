<div class="introduction"><p>In this problem we consider a discrete dynamical system that forms what is called a <dfn class="terminology">Markov chain</dfn> (see <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def_Markov.html" title="Definition 9.4">DefinitionÂ 9.4</a>) which models the number of students attending and skipping a linear algebra class in a semester. Assume the course starts with 1,000,000 students on day 0. For any given class day, 90% of the students who attend a class attend the next class (and 10% of these students skip next class) while only 30% of those absent are there the next time (and 70% of these students continue skipping class).</p></div>

<p>We know that there will be 900,000 students in class on the second day and 100,000 students skipping class. On the third day, 90% of the 900,000 students (attenders) and 30% of the 100,000 students (skippers) will come back to class. Therefore, 840,000 students will attend class on the third day. On the other hand, 10% of 900,000 students and 70% of 100,000 students skip class on the third day, for a total of 160,000 students skipping class. We can use variables to represent these numbers. Let <span class="process-math">\(a_n\)</span> represent the number of students attending class <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> days after first day. So <span class="process-math">\(a_0=1,000,000, a_1=900,000, a_2=840,000\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(s_n\)</span> represent the students skipping class. So <span class="process-math">\(s_0=0, s_1=100,000, s_2=160,000\text{.}\)</span> Find <span class="process-math">\(a_3, s_3, a_4, s_4\text{.}\)</span></p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>
<p>Find a linear expression for <span class="process-math">\(a_{k+1}\)</span> in terms of the previous day values, <span class="process-math">\(a_k\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(s_k\text{,}\)</span> using the story given in the problem. Similarly, express <span class="process-math">\(s_{k+1}\)</span> in terms of <span class="process-math">\(a_k\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(s_k\text{.}\)</span></p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h5>
<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(\vb_k\)</span> represent the state vector: <span class="process-math">\(\vx_k=\begin{bmatrix}a_k\\s_k \end{bmatrix}\text{.}\)</span> It describes the state of the whole system (students attending class and skipping class) in one vector. For example, <span class="process-math">\(\vx_0=\begin{bmatrix}1,000,000\\0 \end{bmatrix}\)</span> is the initial state. The state next day is <span class="process-math">\(\vx_1=\begin{bmatrix}900,000\\100,000 \end{bmatrix}\text{.}\)</span> Using your answer to the previous part, find a matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> which describes how the system changes from one day to the other so that <span class="process-math">\(\vx_{k+1} = A\textbf{x}_k\text{.}\)</span></p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="chap_intro_eigenvals_eigenvects.html#ex_2_b_Markov" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
