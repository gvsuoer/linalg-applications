<p>Mathematics is for everyone â€” whether as a gateway to other fields or as background for higher level mathematics. With linear algebra gaining importance in many applications, we feel that access to or the cost of a textbook should not stand in the way of a successful experience in learning linear algebra. Therefore, we made our textbook available to everyone for free download for their own non-commercial use. We especially encourage its use in linear algebra classrooms for instructors who are looking for an inquiry-based textbook or a supplemental resource to accompany their course.If an instructor would like to make changes to any of the files to better suit your students' needs, we offer source files for the text by making a request to the authors.</p>
