<p>Suppose we want to solve the system <span class="process-math">\(A \vx = \vb\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is an invertible matrix. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act_7_c_cond_num.html" title="Activity 30.4">Activity 30.4</a> illustrates that if <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is really close to being singular, then small changes in the entries of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> can have significant effects on the solution to the system. So the system can be very hard to solve accurately if <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is close to singular. It is important to have a sense of how “good” we can expect any calculated solution to be. Suppose we think we solve the system <span class="process-math">\(A \vx = \vb\)</span> but, through rounding error in our calculation of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> get a solution <span class="process-math">\(\vx'\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(A \vx' = \vb'\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(\vb'\)</span> is not exactly <span class="process-math">\(\vb\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(\Delta \vx\)</span> be the error in our calculated solution and <span class="process-math">\(\Delta \vb\)</span> the difference between <span class="process-math">\(\vb'\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vb\text{.}\)</span> We would like to know how large the error <span class="process-math">\(||\Delta \vx||\)</span> can be. But this isn't exactly the right question. We could scale everything to make <span class="process-math">\(||\Delta \vx||\)</span> as large as we want. What we really need is a measure of the <em class="emphasis">relative error</em> <span class="process-math">\(\frac{||\Delta \vx||}{||\vx||}\text{,}\)</span> or how big the error is compared to <span class="process-math">\(||\vx||\)</span> itself. More specifically, we want to know how large the relative error in <span class="process-math">\(\Delta \vx\)</span> is compared to the relative error in <span class="process-math">\(\Delta \vb\text{.}\)</span> In other words, we want to know how good the relative error in <span class="process-math">\(\Delta \vb\)</span> is as a predictor of the relative error in <span class="process-math">\(\Delta \vx\)</span> (we may have some control over the relative error in <span class="process-math">\(\Delta \vb\text{,}\)</span> perhaps by keeping more significant digits). So we want know if there is a best constant <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> such that</p>
