<p>The idea behind secret sharing algorithms is to break a secret into a number (<span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>) of pieces and give each person one piece. A code is then created in such a way that any <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> individuals could combine their information and learn the secret, but no group of fewer than <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> individuals could. This is called a <span class="process-math">\((k,n)\)</span> threshold scheme. One secret sharing algorithm is Shamir's Secret Sharing, which, as we will see later in this section, involves Lagrange polynomials. In order to implement this algorithm, we will use matrices of linear transformations from polynomials spaces to <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{.}\)</span></p>
