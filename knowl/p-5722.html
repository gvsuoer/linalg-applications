<p>Although is it not necessarily easy to observe, the weights in the decomposition <span class="process-math">\(f = 27 \varphi_{0,0} + 6 \psi_{0,0} + 17 \psi_{1,0} - 7 \psi_{1,1}\)</span> are just averages and differences of the original weights in <span class="process-math">\(f = 50 \varphi_{2,0} + 16 \varphi_{2,1} + 14 \varphi_{2,2} + 28 \varphi_{2,3}\text{.}\)</span> To see how, notice that if we take the overall average of the original weights we obtain the value of <span class="process-math">\(27\text{.}\)</span> If we average the original weights in pairs (<span class="process-math">\(50\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(16\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(14\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(28\)</span>) we obtain the values <span class="process-math">\(33\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(21\text{,}\)</span> and if we take average differences of the original weights in pairs (<span class="process-math">\(50\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(16\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(14\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(28\)</span>) we obtain the values <span class="process-math">\(17\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(-7\text{.}\)</span> We can treat the signal <span class="process-math">\([33 \ 21]^{\tr}\)</span> formed from the average of the pairs of the original weights as a smaller copy of the original signal. The average difference of the entries of this new signal is <span class="process-math">\(6\text{.}\)</span> So the weights in our final decomposition are obtained by differences between successive averages and certain coefficients. The coefficients in our final decomposition <span class="process-math">\(27 \varphi_{0,0} + 6 \psi_{0,0} + 17 \psi_{1,0} - 7 \psi_{1,1}\)</span> are called <dfn class="terminology">wavelet coefficients</dfn>. This is the idea that makes wavelets so useful for image compression. In many images, pixels that are near to each other often have similar coloring or shading. These pixels are coded with numbers that are close in value. In the differencing process, these numbers are replaced with numbers that are close to 0. If there is little difference in the shading of the adjacent pixels, the image will be changed only a little if the shadings are made the same. This results in replacing these small wavelet coefficients with zeros. If the processed vectors contain long strings of zeros, the vectors can be significantly compressed.</p>
