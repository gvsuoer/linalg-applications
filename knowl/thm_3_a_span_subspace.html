<p>First we show that <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> is closed under addition. Let <span class="process-math">\(\vu\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vw\)</span> be vectors in <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span> This means that <span class="process-math">\(\vu\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vw\)</span> are linear combinations of <span class="process-math">\(\vv_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vv_2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\ldots\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vv_k\text{.}\)</span> So there are scalars <span class="process-math">\(a_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(a_2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\ldots\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(a_k\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b_2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\ldots\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b_k\)</span> so that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\vu = a_1\vv_1 + a_2\vv_2 + \cdots + a_k \vv_k \ \ \ \ \ \text{ and }  \ \ \ \ \ \vw = b_1\vv_1 + b_2\vv_2 + \cdots + b_k \vv_k\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>To demonstrate that <span class="process-math">\(\vu + \vw\)</span> is in <span class="process-math">\(W\text{,}\)</span> we need to show that <span class="process-math">\(\vu + \vw\)</span> is a linear combination of <span class="process-math">\(\vv_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vv_2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\ldots\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vv_k\text{.}\)</span> Using the properties of vector addition and scalar multiplication, we find</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
\vu + \vw \amp = (a_1\vv_1 + a_2\vv_2 + \cdots + a_k \vv_k) + (b_1\vv_1 + b_2\vv_2 + \cdots + b_k \vv_k)\\
\amp = (a_1+b_1)\vv_1 + (a_2+b_2)\vv_2 + \cdots + (a_k+b_k) \vv_k\text{.}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Thus <span class="process-math">\(\vu + \vw\)</span> is a linear combination of <span class="process-math">\(\vv_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vv_2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\ldots\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vv_k\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> is closed under vector addition.</p>
<p>Next we show that <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> is closed under scalar multiplication. Let <span class="process-math">\(\vu\)</span> be in <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> be a scalar. Then</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
c\vu = c(a_1\vv_1 + a_2\vv_2 + \cdots + a_k \vv_k) = (ca_1)\vv_1 + (ca_2)\vv_2 + \cdots + (ca_k) \vv_k
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">and <span class="process-math">\(c\vu\)</span> is a linear combination of <span class="process-math">\(\vv_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vv_2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\ldots\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vv_k\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> is closed under multiplication by scalars.</p>
<p>Finally, we show that <span class="process-math">\(\vzero\)</span> is in <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span> Since</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\vzero = 0\vv_1 + 0\vv_2 + \cdots + 0 \vv_k \,\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p><span class="process-math">\(\vzero\)</span> is in <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Since <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> satisfies all of the properties of a subspace as given in definition of a subspace, we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> is a subspace of <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{.}\)</span></p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="chap_R_n.html#thm_3_a_span_subspace" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
