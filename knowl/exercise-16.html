<p>Two students are talking about when a linear system has infinitely many solutions. <blockquote class="blockquote">Student 1: So, if we have a linear system whose augmented matrix has a row of zeros, then the system has infinitely many solutions, doesn't it?</blockquote> <blockquote class="blockquote">Student 2: Well, but what if there is a row of the form <span class="process-math">\([\, 0\, 0\, \ldots\, 0\, |\, b\, ]\)</span> with a non-zero <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> right above the row of 0's?</blockquote> <blockquote class="blockquote">Student 1: OK, maybe I should ask “If we have a consistent linear system whose augmented matrix has a row of zeros, then the system has infinitely many solutions, doesn't it?”</blockquote> <blockquote class="blockquote">Student 2: I don't know. It still doesn't sound enough to me, but I'm not sure why.</blockquote> Is Student 1 right? Or is Student 2's hunch correct? Justify your answer with a specific example if possible.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="chap_matrix_representation.html#exercise-16" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
