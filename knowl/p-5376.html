<p>It is important to note that the set of defining properties of a vector space is intended to be a minimum set. Any other properties of a vector space must be verified or proved using the defining properties. For example, in <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> it is clear that the scalar multiple <span class="process-math">\(0\vv\)</span> is the zero vector for any vector <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{.}\)</span> This might be true in any vector space, but it is not a defining property. Therefore, if this property is true, then we must be able to prove it using just the defining properties. To see how this might work, let <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> be any vector in a vector space <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span> We want to show that <span class="process-math">\(0 \vv = \vzero\)</span> (the existence of the zero vector is property (4)). Using the fact that <span class="process-math">\(0+0 = 0\)</span> and that scalar multiplication distributes over scalar addition, we can see that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
0\vv = (0+0)\vv = 0\vv + 0\vv\text{.}
