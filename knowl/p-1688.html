<p>Notice that this is essentially the same process we used to obtain <span class="process-math">\(\vx_n\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(\vx_{n-1}\text{,}\)</span> and so we can interpret the steady-state vector <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> as telling us what fraction of a random web surfer's time was spent at each web page. If we assume that the time spent at a web page is a measure of its importance, then the steady-state vector tells us the relative importance of each web page. So this steady-state vector provides the page rankings for us. In other words, <blockquote class="blockquote">The importance of a webpage may be measured by the relative size of the corresponding entry in the steady-state vector for an appropriately chosen Markov chain.</blockquote></p>
