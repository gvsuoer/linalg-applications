<p>Suppose there are <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> balls in Bin 1. (In our probability distribution <span class="process-math">\(\vx_0\text{,}\)</span> this happens with probability <span class="process-math">\(x_0\text{.}\)</span>) Then there are four balls in Bin 2. The only way for a ball to change bins is if one of the four balls moves from Bin 2 to Bin 1, putting us in State 1. Regardless of which ball moves, we will always be put in State 1, so this happens with a probability of <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span> In other words, if the probability that Bin 1 contains <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> balls is <span class="process-math">\(x_0\text{,}\)</span> then there is a probability of <span class="process-math">\((1)x_0\)</span> that Bin 1 will contain 1 ball after the move.</p>
