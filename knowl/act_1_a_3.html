<div class="introduction"><p>In this activity we examine the geometry of linear systems of three equations in three unknowns. Recall that each linear equation in three variables has a plane as its solution set. Use a piece of paper to represent each plane.</p></div>
<article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h5>
<p>Is it possible for a general system of three linear equations in three unknowns to have no solutions? If so, geometrically describe this situation and then illustrate each with a specific example using a system of equations. If not, explain why not.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>
<p>Is it possible for a general system of three linear equations in three unknowns to have exactly one solution? If so, geometrically describe this situation and then illustrate each with a specific example using a system of equations. If not, explain why not.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h5>
<p>Is it possible for a general system of three linear equations in three unknowns to have infinitely many solutions? If so, geometrically describe this situation and then illustrate each with a specific example using a system of equations.
