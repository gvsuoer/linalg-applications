<p><a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act_GPS_plane_ex.html" title="Project Activity 30.11">Project Activity 30.11</a> provides the basic idea behind GPS. Suppose you receive a signal from a GPS satellite. The transmission from satellite <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> provides four pieces of information — a location <span class="process-math">\((x_i,y_i,z_i)\)</span> and a time stamp <span class="process-math">\(t_i\)</span> according to the satellite's atomic clock. The time stamp allows the calculation of the distance between you and the <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span>th satellite. The transmission travel time is calculated by subtracting the current time on the GPS receiver from the satellite's time stamp. Distance is then found by multiplying the transmission travel time by the rate, which is the speed of light <span class="process-math">\(c=299792.458\)</span> km/s.<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-55-hidden.html" title="Footnote 55"><sup> 55 </sup></a> So distance is found as <span class="process-math">\(c(t_i-d)\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> is the time at the receiver. This signal places your location within in a sphere of that radius from the center of the satellite. If you receive a signal at the same time from two satellites, then your position is at the intersection of two spheres. As can be seen at left in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_Spheres.html" title="Figure 30.13">Figure 30.13</a>, that intersection is a circle. So your position has been narrowed quite a bit. Now if you receive simultaneous signals from three spheres, your position is narrowed to the intersection of three spheres, or two points as shown at right in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_Spheres.html" title="Figure 30.13">Figure 30.13</a>. So if we could receive perfect information from three satellites, then your location would be exactly determined.</p>
