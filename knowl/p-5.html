<p>Additionally, linear algebra is one of the most applicable branches of mathematics to other disciplines. In fact, the Linear Algebra Curriculum Study Group (<abbr class="initialism">LACSG</abbr>) (formed in 1990 to “initiate substantial and sustained national interest in improving the undergraduate linear  algebra curriculum” and funded by the National Science Foundation) made recommendations for the linear algebra curriculum, one of which was making linear algebra a matrix-oriented course that includes applications to give an indication of the “pervasive use” of linear algebra in other disciplines. <a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-2-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2"><sup> 2 </sup></a> Also, the most recent Committee on the Undergraduate Program in Mathematics (<abbr class="initialism">CUPM</abbr>) report <a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-3-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3"><sup> 3 </sup></a> to the Mathematical Association of America recommends “every Linear Algebra course should incorporate interesting applications, both to highlight the broad usefulness of linear algebra and to help students see the role of the theory in the subject as it is applied.” An important component of this text is its inclusion of significant “real-life” applications of linear algebra to help students see that linear algebra is widely applicable in  many disciplines. Our goals for these materials are several.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>To carefully introduce the ideas behind the definitions and theorems to help students develop intuition and understand the logic behind them.</p></li>
<li><p>To help students understand that mathematics is not done as it is often presented. We expect students to experiment through examples, make conjectures, and then refine their conjectures. We believe it is important for students to learn that definitions and theorems don't pop up completely formed in the minds of most mathematicians, but are the result of much thought and work.</p></li>
<li><p>To help students develop their communication skills in mathematics. We expect our students to read and complete activities before class and come prepared with questions. While in class, students work to discover many concepts on their own through guided activities. Of course, students also individually write solutions to exercises on which they receive significant feedback. Communication skills are essential in any discipline and we place a heavy focus on their development.</p></li>
<li><p>To have students actively involved in each of these items through in-class and out-of-class activities, in-class presentations (this is of course up to the instructor), and problem sets.</p></li>
<li><p>To expose students to significant real-life applications of linear algebra.</p></li>
