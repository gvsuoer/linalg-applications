<p> It is left for the exercises to show that if <span class="process-math">\(T: V \to W\)</span> is an isomorphism, then <span class="process-math">\(T^{-1}: W \to V\)</span> is also an isomorphism. So if there is an isomorphism from a vector space <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> to a vector space <span class="process-math">\(W\text{,}\)</span> then there is an isomorphism from <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span> As a result, we say that <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> are <dfn class="terminology">isomorphic</dfn> vector spaces. It is also true that any vector space is isomorphic to itself, and that if <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> is isomorphic to <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> is isomorphic to <span class="process-math">\(U\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> are also isomorphic. The proof of this result is left to the exercises. From this last property we can conclude that any two vector spaces of dimension <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> are isomorphic vector spaces. This validates statement we made earlier that the vector space <span class="process-math">\(\pol_n\)</span> is for all intents and purposes the same as <span class="process-math">\(\R^{n+1}\text{,}\)</span> since the two spaces are isomorphic. So to understand all finite dimensional vector spaces, it is enough to understand <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{.}\)</span> The next activity provides a little practice with isomorphisms.</p>
