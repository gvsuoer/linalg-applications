<p>For systems of linear equations with a small number of variables, many different methods could be used to find a solution. However, when a system gets large, ad-hoc methods become unwieldy. One of our goals is to develop an algorithmic approach to solving systems of linear equations that can be programmed and applied to any linear system, so we want to work in a very prescribed method as indicated in this activity. Ultimately, once we understand how the algorithm works, we will use calculators/computers to do the work. Apply the elimination method as described to show that the solution set of the following system is <span class="process-math">\((2, -1, 1)\text{:}\)</span></p>
