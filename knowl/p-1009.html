<p>As was hinted at in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/pa_1_f.html" title="Preview Activity 6.1">Preview ActivityÂ 6.1</a>, an important consequence of a linearly independent set is that every vector in the span of the set can be written in one and only one way as a linear combination of vectors in the set. It is this uniqueness that makes linearly independent sets so useful. We explore this idea in this activity for a linearly independent set of three vectors. Let <span class="process-math">\(S = \{ \vv_1, \vv_2, \vv_3 \}\)</span> be a linearly independent set of vectors in <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> and let <span class="process-math">\(\vb\)</span> be a vector in <span class="process-math">\(\Span S\text{.}\)</span> To show that <span class="process-math">\(\vb\)</span> can be written in exactly one way as a linear combination of vectors in <span class="process-math">\(S\text{,}\)</span> we assume that</p>

\begin{equation*}
\vb = x_1 \vv_1 + x_2 \vv_2 + x_3 \vv_3 \ \ \text{ and } \ \ \vb = y_1\vv_1 + y_2 \vv_2 + y_3 \vv_3
