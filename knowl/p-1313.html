<p>Even though we did not have a multiplication operation on vectors, we had a matrix-vector product, which is a special case of a matrix-matrix product since a vector is a matrix with one column. However, generalizing the matrix-vector product to a matrix-matrix product is not immediate as it is not immediately clear what we can do with the other columns. We will consider this question in this section.</p>
