<p><a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act_Leslie_2.html" title="Project Activity 20.7">Project Activity 20.7</a> indicates that, unchecked, the sheep population will grow without bound, roughly exponentially with ratio equal to the dominant eigenvalue of our Leslie matrix <span class="process-math">\(L\text{.}\)</span> Of course, a sheep farmer cannot provide the physical environment or the resources to support an unlimited population of sheep. In addition, most sheep farmers cannot support themselves only by shearing sheep for the wool. Consequently, some harvesting of the sheep population each year for meat and skin is necessary. A sustainable harvesting policy allows for the regular harvesting of some sheep while maintaining the population at a stable level. It is necessary for the farmer to find an optimal harvesting rate to attain this stable population and the following activity leads us through an analysis of how such a harvesting rate can be determined.</p>
