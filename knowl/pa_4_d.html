<div class="introduction"><p>Let <span class="process-math">\(A = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 2\amp 6 \\ 5\amp 3 \end{array} \right]\text{.}\)</span> Our goal is to find a scalar <span class="process-math">\(\lambda\)</span> and a nonzero vector <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(A \vv = \lambda \vv\text{.}\)</span></p></div>

<p>If we have no prior knowledge of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix, we might just begin with a guess. Let <span class="process-math">\(\vx_0 = [1 \ 0]^{\tr}\)</span> be such a guess for an eigenvector. Calculate <span class="process-math">\(A \vx_0\text{.}\)</span> Is <span class="process-math">\(\vx_0\)</span> an eigenvector of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{?}\)</span> Explain.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>
<p>If <span class="process-math">\(\vx_0\)</span> is not a good approximation to an eigenvector of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> then we need to make a better guess. We have little to work with other than just random guessing, but we can use <span class="process-math">\(\vx_1 = A\vx_0\)</span> as another guess. We calculated <span class="process-math">\(\vx_1\)</span> in part 1. Is <span class="process-math">\(\vx_1\)</span> an eigenvector for <span class="process-math">\(A\text{?}\)</span> Explain.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h5>
<p>In parts (a) and (b) you might have noticed that in some sense <span class="process-math">\(\vx_1\)</span> is closer to being an eigenvector of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> than <span class="process-math">\(\vx_0\)</span> was. So maybe continuing this process will get us closer to an eigenvector of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> In other words, for each positive integer <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> we define <span class="process-math">\(\vx_k\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(A \vx_{k-1}\text{.}\)</span> Before we proceed, however, we should note that as we calculate the vectors <span class="process-math">\(\vx_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vx_2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vx_3\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\ldots\text{,}\)</span> the entries in the vectors get large very quickly. So it will be useful to scale the entries so that they stay at a reasonable size, which makes it easier to interpret the output. One way to do this is to divide each vector <span class="process-math">\(\vx_i\)</span> by its largest component in absolute value so that all of the entries stay between <span class="process-math">\(-1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-37-hidden.html" title="Footnote 37"><sup> 37 </sup></a> So in our example we have <span class="process-math">\(\vx_0 = [1 \ 0]^{\tr}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vx_1 = [2/5 \ 1]^{\tr}\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vx_2 = [1 \ 25/34]^{\tr}\text{.}\)</span> Explain why scaling our vectors will not affect our search for an eigenvector.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h5>
<p>Use an appropriate technological tool to find the vectors <span class="process-math">\(\vx_k\)</span> up to <span class="process-math">\(k=10\text{.}\)</span> What do you think the limiting vector <span class="process-math">\(\lim_{k \to \infty} \vx_k\)</span> is? Is this limiting vector an eigenvector of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{?}\)</span> If so, what is the corresponding eigenvalue?</p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="chap_approx_eigenvalues.html#pa_4_d" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
