<p>Once we have our term-document matrix, there are three basic comparisons to make: comparing terms, comparing documents, and comparing terms and documents. Term-document matrices are usually very large, with dimension being the number of terms. By using a reduced SVD we can create a much smaller approximation. In our example, the matrix <span class="process-math">\(A_k\)</span> in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act_LSI_SVD.html" title="Project Activity 29.8">Project Activity 29.8</a> reduces our problem to a <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span>-dimensional space. Intuitively, we can think of LSI as representing terms as averages of all of the documents in which they appear and documents as averages of all of the terms they contain. Through this process, LSI attempts to combine the surface information in our library into a deeper abstraction (the “concept” space) that captures the mutual relationships between terms and documents.</p>
