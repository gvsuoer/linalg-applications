<p>We introduce a little notation to help us describe the efficiency of our calculations. We won't be formal with this notation, rather work with it in an informal way. Big O (the letter “O” ) notation is used to describe the complexity of an algorithm. Generally speaking, in computer science big O notation can be used to describe the run time of an algorithm, the space used by the algorithm, or the number of computations required. The letter “O” is used because the behavior described is also called the order. Big O measures the asymptotic time of an algorithm, not its exact time. For example, if it takes <span class="process-math">\(6n^2-n+8\)</span> steps to complete an algorithm, then we say that the algorithm grows at the order of <span class="process-math">\(n^2\)</span> (we ignore the constants and the smaller power terms, since they become insignificant as <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> increases) and we describe its growth as <span class="process-math">\(O{\left(n^2\right)}\text{.}\)</span> To measure the efficiency of an algorithm to determine a matrix product, we will measure the number of operations it takes to calculate the product.</p>
