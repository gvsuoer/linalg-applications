<p>The space <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> of all vectors with <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> components is a vector space using the standard vector addition and multiplication by scalars.

<p>The set <span class="process-math">\(\pol_1\)</span> of all polynomials of degree less than or equal to 1 with addition and scalar multiplication as defined earlier.

<p>The properties listed in the introduction for <span class="process-math">\(\pol_1\)</span> are equally true for the collection of all polynomials of degree less than or equal to some fixed number. We label as <span class="process-math">\(\pol_n\)</span> this set of all polynomials of degree less than or equal to <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> with the standard addition and scalar multiplication. Note that <span class="process-math">\(\pol_n\)</span> is essentially the same as <span class="process-math">\(\R^{n+1}\text{.}\)</span> More generally, the space <span class="process-math">\(\pol\)</span> of all polynomials is also a vector space with standard addition and scalar multiplication.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h5>

<p>The space <span class="process-math">\(\M_{m \times n}\)</span> (or <span class="process-math">\(\M_{m \times n}(\R)\)</span> when it is important to indicate that the entries of our matrices are real numbers) of all <span class="process-math">\(m \times n\)</span> matrices with real entries with the standard addition and multiplication by scalars we have already defined.

<p>The set of polynomials of positive degree in <span class="process-math">\(\pol_1\)</span> is not a vector space using the standard addition and multiplication by scalars in <span class="process-math">\(\pol_1\)</span> is not a vector space.

<p>The color space where each color is assigned an RGB (red, green, blue) coordinate between 0 and 255, with addition and scalar multiplication defined component-wise, however, does not define a vector space. The color space is not closed under either operation due to the color coordinates being integers ranging from 0 to 255.</p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="chap_vector_spaces.html#example-64" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
