<p>The many beautiful images that are in this text were created by our colleague David Austin, to whom we owe a debt of gratitude. The original <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span> version of the book was partially supported by Grand Valley State University through an internal grant and a sabbatical.</p>
<p>The <abbr class="initialism">HTML</abbr> version of the text is possible because of the work of Rob Beezer and the PreTeXt team for the development of the PreTeXt platform. David Farmer at the American Institute of Mathematics provided an initial PreTeXt conversion. From this version, Ian Curtis, Editorial Assistant for the GVSU Libraries, as part of the <a class="external" href="https://www.gvsu.edu/library/sc/AcceleratingOER" target="_blank">Accelerating Open Educational Resources Initiative at Grand Valley State University</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-4-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4"><sup> 4 </sup></a>, invested a significant amount of time and effort to create the PreTeXt version that you see. This work was conducted with support from the University Libraries and the <abbr class="initialism">GVSU</abbr> President's Innovation Fund.</p>
<p>The code used to generate this book can be found in the <a class="external" href="https://github.com/gvsuoer/linalg-applications" target="_blank"><abbr class="initialism">GVSU</abbr> <abbr class="initialism">OER</abbr> GitHub repository</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-5-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5"><sup> 5 </sup></a>. This includes the PreTeXt <abbr class="initialism">XML</abbr> files, figures, customization files (<abbr class="initialism">XSL</abbr> and <abbr class="initialism">CSS</abbr>), and the output (<abbr class="initialism">HTML</abbr> and <abbr class="initialism">PDF</abbr>).
