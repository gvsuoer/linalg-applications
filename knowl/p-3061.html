<p>As we argued in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/pa_4_b.html" title="Preview Activity 18.1">Preview Activity 18.1</a>, a <span class="process-math">\(2 \times 2\)</span> matrix can have at most 2 eigenvalues. For an <span class="process-math">\(n \times n\)</span> matrix, the characteristic polynomial will be a degree <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> polynomial, and we know from algebra that a degree <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> polynomial can have at most <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> roots. Since an eigenvalue of a matrix is a root of the characteristic polynomial of that matrix, we can conclude that an <span class="process-math">\(n \times n\)</span> matrix can have at most <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> distinct eigenvalues. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act_4_b_1.html" title="Activity 18.2">Activity 18.2</a> (b) shows that a <span class="process-math">\(4 \times 4\)</span> matrix may have fewer than <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> eigenvalues, however. Note that one of these eigenvalues, the eigenvalue 1, appears three times as a root of the characteristic polynomial of the matrix. The number of times an eigenvalue appears as a root of the characteristic polynomial is called the <dfn class="terminology">(algebraic) multiplicity</dfn> of the eigenvalue. More formally:</p>
