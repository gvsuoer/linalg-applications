<p>While the examples we present in this text are small in order to highlight the concepts, matrices that appear in real life applications are often enormous. For example, in Google's PageRank algorithm that is used to determine relative rankings of the importance of web pages, matrices of staggering size are used (most entries in the matrices are zero, but the size of the matrices is still huge). Finding eigenvalues of such large matrices through the characteristic polynomial is impractical. In fact, finding the roots of all but the smallest degree characteristic polynomials is a very difficult problem. As a result, using the characteristic polynomial to find eigenvalues and then finding eigenvectors is not very practical in general, and it is often a better option to use a numeric approximation method. We will consider one such method in this section, the <dfn class="terminology">power method</dfn>.</p>
