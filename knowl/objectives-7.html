<div class="introduction"><p>By the end of this section, you should be able to give precise and thorough answers to the questions listed below. You may want to keep these questions in mind to focus your thoughts as you complete the section.</p></div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>What is a matrix transformation?</p></li>
<li><p>What properties do matrix transformations have? (In particular, what properties make matrix transformations <em class="emphasis">linear</em>?)</p></li>
<li><p>What is the domain of a matrix transformation defined by an <span class="process-math">\(m \times n\)</span> matrix? Why?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the range and codomain of a matrix transformation defined by an <span class="process-math">\(m \times n\)</span> matrix? Why?</p></li>
<li><p>What does it mean for a matrix transformation to be one-to-one? If <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is a matrix transformation represented as <span class="process-math">\(T(\vx) = A \vx\text{,}\)</span> what are the conditions on <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> that make <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> a one-to-one transformation?</p></li>
<li><p>What does it mean for a matrix transformation to be onto? If <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is a matrix transformation represented as <span class="process-math">\(T(\vx) = A \vx\text{,}\)</span> what are the conditions on <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> that make <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> an onto transformation?</p></li>
