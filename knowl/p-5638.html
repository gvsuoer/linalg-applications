<p>The important idea in this section is that of a basis for a vector space. A basis is a minimal spanning set and another equivalent characterization of the “minimal” property is linear independence.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<p>A set <span class="process-math">\(\{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_k\}\)</span> of vectors in a vector space <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> is linearly independent if the vector equation</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
x_1 \vv_1 + x_2 \vv_2 + \cdots + x_k \vv_k = \vzero
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">for scalars <span class="process-math">\(x_1, x_2, \ldots,
x_k\)</span> has only the trivial solution</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = \cdots = x_k = 0\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">If a set of vectors is not linearly independent, then the set is linearly dependent.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A set <span class="process-math">\(\{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_k\}\)</span> of vectors in a vector space <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> is linearly independent if and only if none of the vectors in the set can be written as a linear combination of the remaining vectors in the set.</p></li>
<li><p>A set <span class="process-math">\(\{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_k\}\)</span> of vectors in a vector space <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> is linearly dependent if and only if at least one of the vectors in the set can be written as a linear combination of the remaining vectors in the set.</p></li>
<li>
<p>A basis for a vector space <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> is a subset <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> if</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(\Span \ S = V\)</span> and</p></li>
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is a linearly independent set.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>A basis is important in that it provides us with an efficient way to represent any vector in the vector space — any vector can be written in one and only one way as a linear combination of vectors in a basis.</p></li>
<li><p>To find a basis of a vector space, we can start with a spanning set <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> and toss out any vector in <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> that can be written as a linear combination of the remaining vectors in <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span> We repeat the process with the remaining subset of <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> until we arrive at a linearly independent spanning set. Alternatively, we can find a spanning set for the space and remove any vector that is a linear combination of the others in the spanning set. We can repeat this process until we wind up with a linearly independent spanning set.</p></li>
