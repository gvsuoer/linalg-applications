<p>In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/pa_1_f.html" title="Preview Activity 6.1">Preview Activity 6.1</a> we considered the case where we had a set <span class="process-math">\(\{ \vv_1, \vv_2, \vv_3 \}\)</span> of three vectors, and the vector <span class="process-math">\(\vv_3\)</span> was in the span of <span class="process-math">\(\{ \vv_1, \vv_2 \}\text{.}\)</span> So the vector <span class="process-math">\(\vv_3\)</span> did not add anything to the span of <span class="process-math">\(\{ \vv_1, \vv_2 \}\text{.}\)</span> In other words, the set <span class="process-math">\(\{ \vv_1, \vv_2, \vv_3 \}\)</span> was larger than it needed to be in order to generate the vectors in its span — that is, <span class="process-math">\(\Span \{ \vv_1, \vv_2, \vv_3 \} = \Span \{ \vv_1, \vv_2 \}\text{.}\)</span> However, neither of the vectors in the set <span class="process-math">\(\{ \vv_1, \vv_2 \}\)</span> could be removed without changing its span. In this case, the set <span class="process-math">\(\{ \vv_1, \vv_2 \}\)</span> is what we will call a <dfn class="terminology">minimal spanning set</dfn> or <dfn class="terminology">basis</dfn> for <span class="process-math">\(\Span S\text{.}\)</span> There are two important properties that make <span class="process-math">\(\{ \vv_1, \vv_2 \}\)</span> a basis for <span class="process-math">\(\Span S\text{.}\)</span> The first is that every vector in <span class="process-math">\(\Span S\)</span> can be written as linear combinations of <span class="process-math">\(\vv_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vv_2\)</span> (we also use the terminology that the vectors <span class="process-math">\(\vv_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vv_2\)</span> span <span class="process-math">\(\Span S\)</span>), and the second is that every vector in <span class="process-math">\(\Span S\)</span> can be written in exactly one way as a linear combination of <span class="process-math">\(\vv_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vv_2\text{.}\)</span> This second property is the property of linear independence, and it is the property that makes the spanning set <dfn class="terminology">minimal</dfn>.</p>
