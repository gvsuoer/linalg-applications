<p>Equation <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_4_b_2.html" title="Equation 18.3">(18.3)</a> illustrates that it is most convenient to view the action of <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> in the coordinate system where <span class="process-math">\(\Span \{\vv_1\}\)</span> serves as the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis, <span class="process-math">\(\Span \{\vv_2\}\)</span> serves as the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-axis, and <span class="process-math">\(\Span \{\vv_3\}\)</span> as the <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span>-axis. In this case, we can visualize that when we apply the transformation <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> to a vector <span class="process-math">\(\vb = c_1 \vv_1 + c_2 \vv_2 + c_3 \vv_3\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\)</span> the result is an output vector that is unchanged in the <span class="process-math">\(\vv_1\)</span>-<span class="process-math">\(\vv_2\)</span> plane and scaled by a factor of <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> in the <span class="process-math">\(\vv_3\)</span> direction. For example, consider the box whose sides are determined by the vectors <span class="process-math">\(\vv_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vv_2\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vv_3\)</span> as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_4_b_1.html" title="Figure 18.4">Figure 18.4</a>. The transformation <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> stretches this box by a factor of <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> in the <span class="process-math">\(\vv_3\)</span> direction and leaves everything else alone, as illustrated in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_4_b_1.html" title="Figure 18.4">Figure 18.4</a>. So the entire <span class="process-math">\(\Span \{\vv_1, \vv_2\})\)</span> is unchanged by <span class="process-math">\(T\text{,}\)</span> but <span class="process-math">\(\Span \{\vv_3\})\)</span> is scaled by <span class="process-math">\(2\text{.}\)</span> In this situation, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors provide the most convenient perspective through which to visualize the action of the transformation <span class="process-math">\(T\text{.}\)</span></p>
