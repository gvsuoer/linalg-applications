<p>Unless you have learned some calculus, you have probably never calculated the area under a parabola. In the ancient work <span class="booktitle">Quadrature of the Parabola</span> (3rd century BC), Archimedes determined a method for finding the area of a region bounded by a parabola by using mechanics and then by geometric methods. Once we know how to calculate the area of a region bounded by a parabola, Simpson's Rule uses parabolas to approximate a function, and then approximates the area under the graph of the graph of the function by using the areas under the parabolas. In order to use Simpsons Rule, we need to know how to exactly fit a quadratic function to three points. More details about this process can be found at the end of this section. This idea of fitting a polynomial to a set of data points has uses in other areas as well. For example, two common applications of BÃ©zier curves are font design and drawing tools. When fitting a polynomial to a large set of data points, our systems of equations can become quite large, and can be difficult to solve by hand. In this section we will see how to use matrices to more conveniently represent systems of equations of any size. We also consider how the elimination process works on the matrix representation of a linear system and how we can determine the existence of solutions and the form of solutions of a linear system.</p>
