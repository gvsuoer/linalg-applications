<p>There are many subsets of <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> that are themselves vector spaces. Consider as an example the set <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> of vectors in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> defined by</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
W = \left\{ \left[ \begin{array}{c} x \\ 0 \end{array}  \right] \middle| x \text{ is a real number } \right\}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>In other words, <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> is the set of vectors in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> whose second component is 0. To see that <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> is itself a vector space, we need to demonstrate that <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> satisfies all of the properties listed in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def_3_a_1.html" title="Definition 12.3">Definition 12.3</a>.</p>
<p>To prove the first property, we need to show that the sum of <em class="emphasis">any</em> two vectors in <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> is again in <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span> So we need to choose two <dfn class="terminology">arbitrary</dfn> vectors in <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(\vu = \left[ \begin{array}{c} x \\ 0 \end{array}  \right]\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vv = \left[ \begin{array}{c} y \\ 0 \end{array}  \right]\)</span> be vectors in <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span> Note that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\vu + \vv = \left[ \begin{array}{c} x \\ 0 \end{array}  \right] + \left[ \begin{array}{c} y \\ 0 \end{array}  \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c} x+y \\ 0 \end{array}  \right]\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Since the second component of <span class="process-math">\(\vu + \vv\)</span> is 0, it follows that <span class="process-math">\(\vu + \vv\)</span> is in <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span> Thus, the set <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> is closed under addition.</p>
<p>For the second property, that addition is commutative in <span class="process-math">\(W\text{,}\)</span> we can just use the fact that if <span class="process-math">\(\vu\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> are in <span class="process-math">\(W\text{,}\)</span> they are also vectors in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vu+\vv=\vv+\vu\)</span> is satisfied in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\text{.}\)</span> So the property also holds in <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>A similar argument can be made for property (3).</p>
<p>Property (4) states the existence of the additive identity in <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span> Note that <span class="process-math">\(\vzero\)</span> is an additive identity in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> and if it is also an element in <span class="process-math">\(W\text{,}\)</span> then it will automatically be the additive identity of <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span> Since the zero vector can be written as <span class="process-math">\(\vzero=\left[ \begin{array}{c} x \\ 0 \end{array} \right]\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(x=0\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vzero\)</span> is in <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span> Thus, <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> satisfies property 4.</p>
<p>We will postpone property (5) for a bit since we can show that other properties imply property (5).</p>
<p>Property (6) is a closure property, just like property (1). We need to verify that <em class="emphasis">any</em> scalar multiple of <em class="emphasis">any</em> vector in <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> is again in <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span> Consider an arbitrary vector <span class="process-math">\(\vu\)</span> and an arbitrary scalar <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span> Now</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
a \vu = a\left[ \begin{array}{c} x \\ 0 \end{array}  \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c} ax \\ 0 \end{array}  \right]\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Since the vector <span class="process-math">\(a \vu\)</span> has a 0 as its second component, we see that <span class="process-math">\(a \vu\)</span> is in <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span> Thus, <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> is closed under scalar multiplication.</p>
<p>Properties (7), (8), (9) and (10) only depend on the operations of addition and multiplication by scalars in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\text{.}\)</span> Since these properties depend on the operations and not the vectors, these properties will transfer to <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>We still have to justify property (5) though. Note that since <span class="process-math">\(1-1=0\)</span> in real numbers, by applying property (7) with <span class="process-math">\(a=1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b=-1\text{,}\)</span> we find that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\vzero=0\vu=(a+b)\vu=a\vu+b\vu= \vu + (-1)\vu \,\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Therefore, <span class="process-math">\((-1)\vu\)</span> is an additive inverse for <span class="process-math">\(\vu\text{.}\)</span> Therefore, to show that the additive inverse of any <span class="process-math">\(\vu\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> is also in <span class="process-math">\(W\text{,}\)</span> we simply note that any multiple of <span class="process-math">\(\vu\)</span> is also in <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> and hence <span class="process-math">\((-1)\vu\)</span> must also be in <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Since <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> satisfies all of the properties of a vector space, <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> is a vector space. Any subset of <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> that is itself a vector space using the same operations as in <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> is called a <dfn class="terminology">subspace</dfn> of <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{.}\)</span></p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="chap_R_n.html#ex_3_a_1" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
