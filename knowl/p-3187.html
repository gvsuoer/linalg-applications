<p>In 1202 Leonardo of Pisa (better known as Fibonacci) published <span class="booktitle">Liber Abaci</span> (roughly translated as <span class="booktitle">The Book of Calculation</span>), in which he constructed a mathematical model of the growth of a rabbit population. The problem Fibonacci considered is that of determining the number of pairs of rabbits produced in a given time period beginning with an initial pair of rabbits. Fibonacci made the assumptions that each pair of rabbits more than one month old produces a new pair of rabbits each month, and that no rabbits die. (We ignore any issues about that might arise concerning the gender of the offspring.) If we let <span class="process-math">\(F_n\)</span> represent the number of rabbits in month <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> Fibonacci produced the model</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation}
F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_{n}\text{,}\tag{19.1}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p class="continuation">for <span class="process-math">\(n \geq 0\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(F_0 = 0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(F_1 = 1\text{.}\)</span> The resulting sequence</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21, \ldots
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">is a very famous sequence in mathematics and is called the Fibonacci sequence. This sequence is thought to model many natural phenomena such as number of seeds in a sunflower and anything which grows in a spiral form. It is so famous in fact that it has a journal devoted entirely to it. As a note, while Fibonacci's work <span class="booktitle">Liber Abaci</span> introduced this sequence to the western world, it had been described earlier Sanskrit texts going back as early as the sixth century.</p>
