<p>A basis for a vector space is a spanning set that is as small as it can be. We already saw how to define bases formally in <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{.}\)</span> We will now formally define a basis for a vector space and understand why with this definition a basis is a minimal spanning set. Bases are important because any vector in a vector space can be uniquely represented as a linear combination of basis vectors. We will see in later sections that this representation will allow us to identify any vector space with a basis of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> vectors with <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{.}\)</span></p>
