<p>Sierpinski triangles and Koch's curves have become common phrases in many mathematics departments across the country. These objects are examples of what are called <dfn class="terminology">fractals</dfn>, beautiful geometric constructions that exhibit self-similarity. Fractals are applied in a variety of ways: they help make smaller antennas (e.g., for cell phones) and are used in fiberoptic cables, among other things. In addition, fractals can be used to model realistic objects, such as the Black Spleenwort fern depicted as a fractal image in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_Fern.html" title="Figure 37.1">Figure 37.1</a>. As we will see later in this section, one way to construct a fractal is with an <dfn class="terminology">Iterated Function System</dfn> (IFS).</p>
