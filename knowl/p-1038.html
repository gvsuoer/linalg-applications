<p><a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act_1_f_4.html" title="Activity 6.6">Activity 6.6</a> also illustrates a general process by which we can find a minimal spanning set — that is the smallest subset of vectors that has the same span. This process will be useful later when we consider vectors in arbitrary vector spaces. The idea is that if we can write one of the vectors in a set <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> as a linear combination of the remaining vectors, then we can remove that vector from the set and maintain the same span. In other words, begin with the span of a set <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> and follow these steps:</p>
<dl class="description-list">
<dt>Step 1</dt>
<dd><p>If <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is a linearly independent set, we already have a minimal spanning set.</p></dd>
<dt>Step 2</dt>
<dd><p>If <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is not a linearly independent set, then one of the vectors in <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is a linear combination of the others. Remove that vector from <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> to obtain a new set <span class="process-math">\(T\text{.}\)</span> It will be the case that <span class="process-math">\(\Span \ T = \Span \ S\text{.}\)</span></p></dd>
<dt>Step 3</dt>
<dd><p>If <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is a linearly independent set, then <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is a minimal spanning set. If not, repeat steps 2 and 3 for the set <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> until you arrive at a linearly independent set.</p></dd>
