<p>Each of the systems that we solved so far have had a unique (exactly one) solution. The geometric representation of linear systems with two equations in two variables shows that this does not always have to be the case. We also have linear systems with no solution and systems with infinitely many solutions. We now consider the problem of how to represent the set of solutions of a linear system that has infinitely many solutions. (Systems with infinitely many solutions will also be of special interest to us a bit later when we study eigenspaces of a matrix.)</p>
