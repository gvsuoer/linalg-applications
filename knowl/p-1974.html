<p>As we can see from the scatterplot, the relationship between the GDP and consumption is not exactly linear, but looks to be very close. To make correlations between GDP and consumption as the authors did, we need to understand how they determined their approximate linear relationship between the variables. With a good approximation function we can then compare the variables, extrapolate from the data, and make predictions or interpolate and estimate between data points. For example, we could use our approximation function to predict, as the authors did, how changes in consumption affect GDP (or vice versa). Later in this section we will see how to find the least squares line to fit this data — the best linear approximation to the data. This involves finding a vector in a certain subspace of <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> that is closest to a given vector. Linear least squares approximation is a special case of a more general process that we will encounter in later sections where we learn how to project sets onto subspaces.</p>
