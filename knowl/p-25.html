<p>We have identified some accessibility issues which were beyond the author's and <abbr class="initialism">GVSU</abbr> Libraries' capacity to address in the course of this adaptation. These present an opportunity for future adaptation or revision by educators with expertise in accessibility issues in mathematics documents. Known accessibility issues include:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>A small number of exercises and activities in this text require students to visually interpret diagrams or figures. These activities cannot be made accessible through alt text alone, and may need to be redesigned or replaced for full accessibility.</p></li>
<li><p>Some visual representations of concepts (see, for example, <a href="chap_determinants.html" class="internal" title="Section 17: The Determinant">Section 17</a>) are not accessible to screen readers. However, they are fully described in text.</p></li>
<li><p>The matrix table represented in <a href="chap_SVD.html" class="internal" title="Section 29: The Singular Value Decomposition">Section 29</a> is too complex to encode with the current functionality of PreTeXt and MathJax. It is presented as an image and is not accessible to screen readers. Full accessibility likely requires redesigning the project or waiting for expanded features in PreTeXt and MathJax.</p></li>
