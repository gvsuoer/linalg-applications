<div class="introduction"><p>By the end of this section, you should be able to give precise and thorough answers to the questions listed below. You may want to keep these questions in mind to focus your thoughts as you complete the section.</p></div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Under what conditions can we add two matrices and how is the matrix sum defined?</p></li>
<li><p>Under what conditions can we multiply a matrix by a scalar and how is a scalar multiple of a matrix defined?</p></li>
<li><p>Under what conditions can we multiply two matrices and how is the matrix product defined?</p></li>
<li><p>What properties do matrix addition, scalar multiplication of matrices and matrix multiplication satisfy? Are these properties similar to properties that are satisfied by vector operations?</p></li>
<li><p>What are two properties that make matrix multiplication fundamentally different than our standard product of real numbers?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the interpretation of matrix multiplication from the perspective of linear transformations?</p></li>
<li><p>How is the transpose of a matrix defined?</p></li>
