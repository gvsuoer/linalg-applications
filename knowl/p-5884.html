<p>To summarize, the unit eigenvector for the largest eigenvalue of <span class="process-math">\(XX^{\tr}\)</span> indicates the direction in which the data has the greatest variance. The direction of the unit eigenvector for the smaller eigenvalue shows the direction in which the data has the second largest variance. This direction is also perpendicular to the first (indicating <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> covariance). The directions of the eigenvectors are called the <dfn class="terminology">principal components</dfn> of <span class="process-math">\(X\text{.}\)</span> The eigenvector with the highest eigenvalue is the first principal component of the data set and the other eigenvectors are ordered by the eigenvalues, highest to lowest. The principal components provide a new coordinate system from which to view our data — one in which we can see the maximum variance and in which there is zero covariance.</p>
