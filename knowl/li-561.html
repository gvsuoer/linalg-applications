<p>Suppose we have 1 ball in Bin 1. There are four ways this can happen (since there are four balls, and the one in Bin 1 is selected at random from the four balls), so the probability of a given ball being in Bin 1 is <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{4}\text{.}\)</span></p>
<ul class="circle">
<li><p>If the ball in Bin 1 moves, that move puts us in State <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span> In other words, if the probability that Bin 1 contains 1 ball is <span class="process-math">\(x_1\text{,}\)</span> then there is a probability of <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{4}x_1\)</span> that Bin 1 will contain <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> balls after a move.</p></li>
<li><p>If any of the <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> balls in Bin 2 moves (each moves with probability <span class="process-math">\(\frac{3}{4}\)</span>), that move puts us in State 2. In other words, if the probability that Bin 1 contains 1 ball is <span class="process-math">\(x_1\text{,}\)</span> then there is a probability of <span class="process-math">\(\frac{3}{4}x_1\)</span> that Bin 1 will contain <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> balls after a move.</p></li>
