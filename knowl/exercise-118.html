<p>Two students are talking about examples of subspaces. <blockquote class="blockquote">Student 1: The <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> is a subspace. It is generated by the vector <span class="process-math">\(\left[ \begin{array}{c} 1\\0 \end{array} \right]\text{.}\)</span>
</blockquote> <blockquote class="blockquote">Student 2: Similarly <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> is a subspace of <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\text{.}\)</span>
</blockquote> <blockquote class="blockquote">Student 1: I'm not sure if that will work. Can we fit <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> inside <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\text{?}\)</span> Don't we need <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> to be a subset of <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\)</span> if it is a subspace of <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\text{?}\)</span>
</blockquote> <blockquote class="blockquote">Student 2: Of course we can fit <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> inside <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\text{.}\)</span> We can think of <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> as vectors <span class="process-math">\(\left[ \begin{array}{c} a\\b\\0 \end{array} \right]\text{.}\)</span> That's the <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span>-plane.</blockquote> <blockquote class="blockquote">Student 1: I don't know. The vector <span class="process-math">\(\left[ \begin{array}{c} a\\b\\0 \end{array} \right]\)</span> is not exactly same as <span class="process-math">\(\left[ \begin{array}{c} a\\b \end{array} \right]\text{.}\)</span>
</blockquote> <blockquote class="blockquote">Student 2: Well, <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> is a plane and so is the <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span>-plane. So they must be equal, shouldn't they?</blockquote> <blockquote class="blockquote">Student 1: But there are infinitely many planes in <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\text{.}\)</span> They can't all be equal to <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\text{.}\)</span> They all “look like”<span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> but I don't think we can say they are equal.</blockquote> Which student is correct? Is <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> a subspace of <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\text{,}\)</span> or not? Justify your answer.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="chap_R_n.html#exercise-118" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
