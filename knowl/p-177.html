<p>Linear algebra comes into play when analyzing a circuit based on the relationship between current, resistance, and potential. Three basic principles govern current low in a circuit.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>
<p>Resistance <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> in ohms (<span class="process-math">\(\Omega\)</span>) can be thought of as a measure of how difficult it is to move a charge along a circuit. When a current flows through a resistor, it must expend some energy, called a <em class="emphasis">voltage drop</em>. Ohm's Law states that the voltage drop <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> across a resistor is the product of the current <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> passing through the resistor and the resistance <span class="process-math">\(R\text{.}\)</span> That is,</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
E = IR\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Kirchoff's Current Law states that at any point in an electrical circuit, the sum of currents flowing into that point is equal to the sum of currents flowing out of that point.</p></li>
<li><p>Kirchoff's Voltage Law says that around any closed loop the sum of the voltage drops is equal to the sum of the voltage rises.</p></li>
