<p>We now consider the motivation behind this definition by thinking about the matrix transformations corresponding to each of the matrices <span class="process-math">\(A, B\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(AB\text{.}\)</span> Recall that left multiplication by an <span class="process-math">\(m \times n\)</span> matrix <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> defines a transformation <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\R^m\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(T(\vx)=B\vx\text{.}\)</span> The domain of <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> because the number of components of <span class="process-math">\(\vx\)</span> have to match the number of entries in each of row of <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> in order for the matrix-vector product <span class="process-math">\(B\vx\)</span> to be defined. Similarly, a <span class="process-math">\(k \times m\)</span> matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> defines a transformation <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(\R^m\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\R^k\text{.}\)</span> Since transformations are functions, we can compose them as long as the output vectors of the inside transformation lie in the domain of the outside transformation. Therefore if <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is the inside transformation and <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is the outside transformation, the composition <span class="process-math">\(S\circ T\)</span> is defined. So a natural question to ask is if we are given</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>a transformation <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\R^m\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(T(\vx) = B \vx\)</span> for an <span class="process-math">\(m \times n\)</span> matrix <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> and</p></li>
<li><p>a transformation <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(\R^m\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\R^k\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(S(\vy) = A \vy\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(k \times m\)</span> matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">is there a matrix that represents the transformation <span class="process-math">\(S \circ T\)</span> defined by <span class="process-math">\((S\circ T)(\vx)=S(T(\vx))\text{?}\)</span> We investigate this question in the next activity in the special case of a <span class="process-math">\(2\times 3\)</span> matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and a <span class="process-math">\(3\times 2\)</span> matrix <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span></p>
