<p>To model the system of balls in bins we need to understand how the system can transform from one state to another. It suffices to count the number of balls in Bin 1 (since the remaining balls will be in Bin 2). Even though the balls are labeled, our count only cares about how many balls are in each bin. Let <span class="process-math">\(\vx_0 = [x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4]^{\tr}\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(x_i\)</span> is the probability that Bin 1 contains <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> balls, and let <span class="process-math">\(\vx_1 = \left[ x_0^1, x_1^1, x_2^1, x_3^1, x_4^1 \right]^{\tr}\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(x_i^1\)</span> is the probability that Bin 1 contains <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> balls after the first move. We will call the vectors <span class="process-math">\(\vx_0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vx_1\)</span> <dfn class="terminology">probability distributions</dfn> of balls in bins. Note that since all four balls have to be placed in some bin, the sum of the entries in our probability distribution vectors must be <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span> Recall that a move is an instance when a ball changes bins. We want to understand how <span class="process-math">\(\vx_1\)</span> is obtained from <span class="process-math">\(\vx_0\text{.}\)</span> In other words, we want to figure out what the probability that Bin 1 contains 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 balls after one ball changes bins if our initial probability distribution of balls in bins is <span class="process-math">\(\vx_0\text{.}\)</span></p>
