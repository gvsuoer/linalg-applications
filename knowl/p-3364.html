<p>The Leslie Matrix (also called the Leslie Model) is a powerful model for describing an age distributed growth of a population that is closed to migration. In a Leslie model, it is usually the case that only one gender (most often female) is considered. As an example, we will later consider a population of sheep that is being grown commercially. A natural question that we will address is how we can harvest the population to build a sustainable environment.</p>
