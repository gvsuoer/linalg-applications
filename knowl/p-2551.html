<p>Since every vector in a subspace of <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> can be written uniquely as a linear combination of vectors in a basis for the subspace, a basis provides us with the most efficient and convenient way to represent vectors in the subspace. Until now we have been given a set of vectors and have been asked to find a basis from that set, so an important question to address is how we can find a basis for a subspace <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> starting from scratch. Here is one way. If <span class="process-math">\(W = \{\vzero\}\text{,}\)</span> then the dimension of <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> is 0 and <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> has no basis. So suppose <span class="process-math">\(\dim(W) &gt; 0\text{.}\)</span> Start by choosing any nonzero vector <span class="process-math">\(\vw_1\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(\B_1 = \{\vw_1\}\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(\B_1\)</span> spans <span class="process-math">\(W\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(\B_1\)</span> is a basis for <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span> If not, there is a vector <span class="process-math">\(\vw_2\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> that is not in <span class="process-math">\(\Span(\B_1)\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(\B_2 = \{\vw_1, \vw_2\}\)</span> is a linearly independent set. If <span class="process-math">\(\Span(\B_2) = W\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(\B_2\)</span> is a basis for <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> and we are done. If not, repeat the process. Since any basis for <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> can contain at most <span class="process-math">\(n=\dim(\R^n)\)</span> vectors, we know the process must stop at some point. This process also allows us to construct a basis for a vector space that contains a given nonzero vector.</p>
