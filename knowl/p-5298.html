<p>There is a problem with the above analysis â€” calculating the distances. These distances are determined by the time it takes for the signal to travel from the satellite to the GPS receiver. The times are measured by the clocks in the satellites and the clocks in the receivers. Since the GPS receiver clock is unlikely to be perfectly synchronized with the satellite clock, the distance calculations are not perfect. In addition, the rate at which the signal travels can change as the signal moves through the ionosphere and the troposphere. As a result, the calculated distance measurements are not exact, and are referred to as <dfn class="terminology">pseudoranges</dfn>. In our calculations we need to factor in the error related to the time discrepancy and other factors. We will incorporate these errors into our measure of <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> and treat <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> as an unknown. (Of course, this is all more complicated that is presented here, but this provides the general idea.)</p>
