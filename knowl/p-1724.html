<p>To this point we have solved systems of linear equations with matrix forms <span class="process-math">\(A \vx = \vb\)</span> by row reducing the augmented matrices <span class="process-math">\([A \ | \ \vb]\text{.}\)</span> These linear matrix-vector equations should remind us of linear algebraic equations of the form <span class="process-math">\(ax = b\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are real numbers. Recall that we solved an equation of the form <span class="process-math">\(ax=b\)</span> by dividing both sides by <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> (provided <span class="process-math">\(a \neq 0\)</span>), giving the solution <span class="process-math">\(x = \frac{b}{a}\text{,}\)</span> or equivalently <span class="process-math">\(x = a^{-1}b\text{.}\)</span> The important property that the number <span class="process-math">\(a^{-1}\)</span> has that allows us to solve a linear equation in this way is that <span class="process-math">\(a^{-1}a = 1\text{,}\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(a^{-1}\)</span> is the multiplicative inverse of <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span> We can solve certain types of matrix equations <span class="process-math">\(A \vx = \vb\)</span> in the same way, provided we can find a matrix <span class="process-math">\(A^{-1}\)</span> with similar properties. We investigate this situation in this section.</p>
