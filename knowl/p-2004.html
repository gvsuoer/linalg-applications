<p><a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_vector_properties.html" title="Theorem 4.4">Theorem 4.4</a> in <a href="chap_vector_representation.html" class="internal" title="Section 4: Vector Representation">Section 4</a> shows that <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> is itself a vector space. As we will see, there are many other sets that have the same algebraic structure. By focusing on this structure and the properties of these operations, we can extend the theory of vectors we developed so far to a broad range of objects, making it easier to work with them. For example, we can consider linear combinations of functions or matrices, or define a basis for different types of sets of objects. Such algebraic tools provide us with new ways of looking at these sets of objects, including a geometric intuition when working with these sets. In this section, we will analyze subsets of <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> which behave similar to <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> algebraically. We will call such sets <dfn class="terminology">subspaces</dfn>. In a later chapter we will encounter different kinds of sets that are also vector spaces.</p>
