<p>There are two useful ways we can interpret the results of our work so far. An eigenvector of <span class="process-math">\(XX^{\tr}\)</span> that corresponds to the largest (also called the <em class="emphasis">dominant</em>) eigenvalue <span class="process-math">\(\lambda_1\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\([0.66 \ 0.76]^{\tr}\text{.}\)</span> A plot of the centered data along with the eigenspace <span class="process-math">\(E_{\lambda_1}\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(XX^{\tr}\)</span> spanned by <span class="process-math">\(\vv_1 = [0.66 \ 0.76]^{\tr}\)</span> is shown at left in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_PCA_pc.html" title="Figure 33.9">Figure 33.9</a>. The eigenvector <span class="process-math">\(\vv_1\)</span> is called the <dfn class="terminology">first principal component</dfn> of <span class="process-math">\(X\text{.}\)</span> Notice that this line <span class="process-math">\(E_{\lambda_1}\)</span> indicates the direction of greatest variation in the data. That is, the sum of the squares of the differences between the data points and the mean is as large as possible in this direction. In other words, when we project the data points onto <span class="process-math">\(E_{\lambda_1}\text{,}\)</span> as shown at right in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_PCA_pc.html" title="Figure 33.9">Figure 33.9</a>, the variation of the resulting points is larger than it is for any other line. In other words, the data is most spread out in this direction.</p>
