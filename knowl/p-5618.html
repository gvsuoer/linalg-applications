<p><a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act_5_b_2.html" title="Activity 32.3">Activity 32.3</a> and <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act_5_b_2_b.html" title="Activity 32.4">Activity 32.4</a> give us two ways of finding a basis for a subspace <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> of a vector space <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> assuming <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> has a basis with finitely many vectors. One way (illustrated in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act_5_b_2.html" title="Activity 32.3">Activity 32.3</a>) is to start by choosing any non-zero vector <span class="process-math">\(\vw_1\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(\CS_1 = \{\vw_1\}\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(\CS_1\)</span> spans <span class="process-math">\(W\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(\CS_1\)</span> is a basis for <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span> If not, there is a vector <span class="process-math">\(\vw_2\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> that is not in <span class="process-math">\(\Span \ \CS_1\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(\CS_2 = \{\vw_1, \vw_2\}\)</span> is a linearly independent set. If <span class="process-math">\(\Span \ \CS_2 = W\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(\CS_2\)</span> is a basis for <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> and we are done. If not, repeat the process. We will show later that this process must stop as long as we know that <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> has a basis with fini tely many vectors.</p>
