<p><a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act_MIMO_Householder.html" title="Project Activity 25.10">Project Activity 25.10</a> illustrates the general method for finding a QR decomposition of a matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> by using Householder transformations to reduce <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to an upper triangular matrix <span class="process-math">\(R\text{.}\)</span> The product of the Householder matrices is then the orthogonal matrix <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{.}\)</span> One final note: You may have noticed that the matrix <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> you found in this project was a square <span class="process-math">\(5 \times 5\)</span> matrix and <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> was a <span class="process-math">\(5 \times 3\)</span> matrix, and so they have different sizes than the QR decomposition in this section. We could use the Gram-Schmidt process to obtain these larger matrices by extending the columns of a <span class="process-math">\(5 \times 3\)</span> matrix <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> to form an orthonormal basis for <span class="process-math">\(\R^5\text{.}\)</span> However, if we want a QR decomposition for <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> in which <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(5 \times 3\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(3 \times 3\)</span> from the work we did in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act_MIMO_Householder.html" title="Project Activity 25.10">Project Activity 25.10</a>, we can simply delete the last two columns of the matrix <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> and the last two rows of the matrix <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> we calculated. This smaller QR decomposition is often referred to as a <dfn class="terminology">thin</dfn> QR decomposition.</p>
