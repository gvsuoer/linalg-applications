<p>The properties we saw for polynomials in <span class="process-math">\(\pol_1\)</span> stated above are the same as the properties for vector addition and multiplication by scalars in <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{,}\)</span> as well as matrix addition and multiplication by scalars identified in <a href="chap_matrix_operations.html" class="internal" title="Section 8: Matrix Operations">Section 8</a>. This indicates that polynomials in <span class="process-math">\(\pol_1\text{,}\)</span> vectors in <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{,}\)</span> and the set of <span class="process-math">\(m \times n\)</span> matrices behave in much the same way as regards their addition and multiplication by scalars. There is an even closer connection between linear polynomials and vectors in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\text{.}\)</span> An element <span class="process-math">\(a(t) = a_0 + a_1t\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\pol_1\)</span> can be naturally associated with the vector <span class="process-math">\(\left[ \begin{array}{c} a_0 \\ a_1 \end{array}  \right]\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\text{.}\)</span> All the results of polynomial addition and multiplication by scalars then translate to corresponding results of addition and multiplication by scalars of vectors in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\text{.}\)</span> So for all intents and purposes, as far as addition and multiplication by scalars is concerned, there is no difference between elements in <span class="process-math">\(\pol_1\)</span> and vectors in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> — the only difference is how we choose to present the elements (as polynomials or as vectors). This sameness of structure of our sets as it relates to addition and multiplication by scalars is the type of similarity mentioned in the introduction. We can study all of the types of objects that exhibit this same structure at one time by studying vector spaces.</p>
