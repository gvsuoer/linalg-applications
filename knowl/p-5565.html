<p>Now we can apply wavelets to the image and compress it. Essentially, wavelets act by averaging and differencing. The averaging creates smaller versions of the image and the differencing keeps track of how far the smaller version is from a previous copy. The differencing often produces many small (close to 0) entries, and so replacing these entries with 0 doesn't have much effect on the image (this is called <em class="emphasis">thresholding</em>). By introducing long strings of zeros into our data, we are able to store a (compressed) copy of the image in a smaller amount of space. For example, using a threshold value of 10 produces the flower image shown at right in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_Flower_1.html" title="Figure 32.1">Figure 32.1</a>.</p>
