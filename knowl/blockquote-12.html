<h4 class="heading"><span class="type">Quotation</span></h4>However, we can appreciate that linear regression model describes the correlation between the value of gross domestic product and the value of final consumption and may be transcribed following form: PIB = -3127.51+ 1.22 CF. Analysis of correlation between GDP and final consumption (private consumption and public consumption) will result in an increase of 1.22 units of monetary value of gross domestic product. We can conclude that the Gross Domestic Product of our country is strongly influenced by the private and public consumption.</blockquote>
