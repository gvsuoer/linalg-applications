<p>Since an eigenvector of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> corresponding to eigenvalue <span class="process-math">\(\lambda\)</span> is a non-trivial solution to the homogeneous equation <span class="process-math">\((A - \lambda I_n)\vx = \vzero\text{,}\)</span> the eigenvalues <span class="process-math">\(\lambda\)</span> which work are those for which the matrix <span class="process-math">\(A-\lambda I_n\)</span> has linearly dependent columns, or for which the row echelon form of the matrix <span class="process-math">\(A-\lambda I_n\)</span> does not have a pivot in every column. When we need to test if a specific <span class="process-math">\(\lambda\)</span> is an eigenvalue, this method works fine. However, finding which <span class="process-math">\(\lambda\)</span>'s will work in general involves row reducing a matrix with <span class="process-math">\(\lambda\)</span>'s subtracted on the diagonal algebraically. For certain types of matrices, this method still provides us the eigenvalues quickly. For general matrices though, row reducing algebraically is not efficient. We will later see an algebraic method which uses the determinants to find the eigenvalues.</p>
