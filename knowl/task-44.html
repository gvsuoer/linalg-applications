<p>The circuit pictured in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_Wheatstone.html" title="Figure 1.11">Figure 1.11</a> is called a <em class="emphasis">Wheatstone bridge</em> (invented by Samuel Hunter Christie in 1833 and popularized by Sir Charles Wheatstone in 1843). The Wheatstone bridge is a circuit designed to determine an unknown resistance by balancing two paths in a circuit. It is set up so that the resistances of resistors <span class="process-math">\(R_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(R_2\)</span> are known, <span class="process-math">\(R_3\)</span> is a variable resistor and we want to find the resistance of <span class="process-math">\(R_4\text{.}\)</span> The resistor <span class="process-math">\(R_5\)</span> is replaced with a voltmeter, and the resistance of <span class="process-math">\(R_3\)</span> is varied until the voltmeter reads <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span> This balances the circuit and tells the resistance of resistor <span class="process-math">\(R_4\text{.}\)</span> Show that if the current <span class="process-math">\(I_5\)</span> in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_Wheatstone.html" title="Figure 1.11">Figure 1.11</a> is <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> (so the circuit is balanced), then <span class="process-math">\(R_4 = \frac{R_2R_3}{R_1}\)</span> (which is how we calculate the unknown resistance <span class="process-math">\(R_4\)</span>). Do this in general and do not use any specific values for the resistances or the voltage.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="chap_intro_linear_systems.html#task-44" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
