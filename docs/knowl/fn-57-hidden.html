<body class="ignore-math"><div class="fn">It might seem that we should divide by <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> instead of <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span> in the variance, but it is generally accepted to do this for reasons we won't get into. Suffice it to say that if we are using a sample of the entire population, then dividing by <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span> provides a variance whose square root is closer to the standard deviation than we would get if we divide by <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> If we are calculating the variance of an entire population, then we would divide by <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span>
