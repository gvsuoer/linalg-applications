<p>What is it about this reduced form of the augmented matrix that indicates that the system has infinitely many solutions?</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(ii)</span></h6>
<p>Since the system has infinitely many solutions, we will not be able to explicitly determine values for each of the variables. Instead, at least one of the variables can be chosen arbitrarily. What is it about the reduced form of the augmented matrix that indicates that <span class="process-math">\(x_3\)</span> is convenient to choose as the arbitrary variable?</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(iii)</span></h6>
<p>Letting <span class="process-math">\(x_3\)</span> be arbitrary (we call <span class="process-math">\(x_3\)</span> a <em class="emphasis">free</em> variable), use the second row to show that <span class="process-math">\(x_2 = 1-2x_3\)</span> (so that we can write <span class="process-math">\(x_2\)</span> in terms of the arbitrary variable <span class="process-math">\(x_3\)</span>).</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(iv)</span></h6>
<p>Use the first row to show that <span class="process-math">\(x_1 = 5x_3-1\)</span> (and we can write <span class="process-math">\(x_1\)</span> in terms of the arbitrary variable <span class="process-math">\(x_3\)</span>). Compare this to the solutions from part (b).</p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="chap_matrix_representation.html#task-57" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
