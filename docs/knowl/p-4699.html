<p>Try an experiment with a tennis racket (or a squash racket, or a ping pong paddle). Let us define a 3D coordinate system with the center of the racket as the origin with the head of the racket lying in the <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span>-plane. We let <span class="process-math">\(\vu_1\)</span> be the vector in the direction of the handle and <span class="process-math">\(\vu_2\)</span> the perpendicular direction (still lying in the plane defined by the head) as illustrated in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_tennis_racket.html" title="Figure 28.1">FigureÂ 28.1</a>. We then let <span class="process-math">\(\vu_3\)</span> be a vector perpendicular to the plane of the head. Hold the racket by the handle and spin it to make one rotation around the <span class="process-math">\(\vu_1\)</span> axis. This is pretty easy. It is also not difficult to throw the racket so that it rotates around the <span class="process-math">\(\vu_3\text{.}\)</span> Now toss the racket into the air to make one complete rotation around the axis of the vector <span class="process-math">\(\vu_2\)</span> and catch the handle. Repeat this several times. You should notice that in most instances, the racket will also have made a half rotation around the <span class="process-math">\(\vu_1\)</span> axis so that the other face of the racket now points up. This is quite different than the rotations around the <span class="process-math">\(\vu_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vu_3\)</span> axes. A good video that illustrates this behavior can be seen at <a class="external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dqCQqI-Gis" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">youtube.com/watch?v=4dqCQqI-Gis</code></a>.</p>
