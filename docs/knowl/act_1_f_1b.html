<div class="introduction"><p>The statement of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_dependence.html" title="Theorem 6.4">Theorem 6.4</a> is a bi-conditional statement (an if and only if statement). To prove this statement about the set <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> we need to show two things about <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span> One: we must demonstrate that if <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is a linearly dependent set, then at least one vector in <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is a linear combination of the other vectors (this is the “only if” part ofthe biconditional statement) and Two: if at least one vector in <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is a linear combination of the others, then <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is linearly dependent (this is the “if” part of the biconditional statement). We illustrate the main idea of the proof using a three vector set <span class="process-math">\(S = \{ \vv_1, \vv_2, \vv_3 \}\text{.}\)</span></p></div>
<article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h4>
<p>First let us assume that <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is a linearly dependent set and show that at least one vector in <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is a linear combination of the other vectors. Since <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is linearly dependent we can write the zero vector as a linear combination of <span class="process-math">\(\vv_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vv_2\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vv_3\)</span> with at least one nonzero weight. For example, suppose</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation}
2 \vv_1 + 3 \vv_2 + 4 \vv_3 = \vzero\tag{6.1}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Solve Equation <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_1_f_dependence_thm_1.html" title="Equation 6.1">(6.1)</a> for the vector <span class="process-math">\(\vv_2\)</span> to show that <span class="process-math">\(\vv_2\)</span> can be written as a linear combination of <span class="process-math">\(\vv_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vv_3\text{.}\)</span> Conclude that <span class="process-math">\(\vv_2\)</span> is a linear combination of the other vectors in the set <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span></p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h4>
<p>Now we assume that at least one of the vectors in <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is a linear combination of the others. For example, suppose that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation}
\vv_3 = \vv_1 + 5 \vv_2\text{.}\tag{6.2}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Use vector algebra to rewrite Equation <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_1_f_dependence_thm_2.html" title="Equation 6.2">(6.2)</a> so that <span class="process-math">\(\vzero\)</span> is expressed as a linear combination of <span class="process-math">\(\vv_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vv_2\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vv_3\)</span> such that the weight on <span class="process-math">\(\vv_3\)</span> is not zero. Conclude that the set <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is linearly dependent.</p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="lin_indep_intro_new.html#act_1_f_1b">in-context</a></span>
