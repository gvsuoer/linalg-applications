<p>Technically, we don't really add two equations or multiply an equation by a scalar. When we refer to a scalar multiple of an equation, we mean the equation obtained by equating the scalar multiple of the expression on the left side of the equation and the same scalar multiple of the expression on the right side of the equation. Similarly, when we refer to a sum of two equations, we don't really add the equations themselves. Instead, we mean the equation obtained by equating the sum of the expressions on the left sides of the equations to the sum of the expressions on the right sides of the equations. We will use the terminology “scalar multiple of an equation” and “sum of two equations” as shorthand to mean what is described here.</p>
