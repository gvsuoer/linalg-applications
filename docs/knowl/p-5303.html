<p>We have previously seen that <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> and the set of fixed size matrices have a nice algebraic structure when endowed with the addition and scalar multiplication operations. In fact, as we will see, there are many other sets of elements that have the same kind of structure with natural addition and scalar multiplication operations. Due to this underlying similar structure, these sets are connected in some way and can all be studied jointly. Mathematicians look for these kinds of connections between seemingly dissimilar objects and, from a mathematical standpoint, it is convenient to study all of these similar structures at once by combining them into a larger collection. This motivates the idea of a <dfn class="terminology">vector space</dfn> that we will investigate in this chapter.</p>
