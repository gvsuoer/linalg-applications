<p>Modern cryptology uses mathematical theory that can be implemented with computer hardware and algorithms. The security of public key systems is largely based on mathematical problems that are very difficult to solve. For example, the security of the RSA system relies on the fact that it is computationally difficult to find prime factors of very large numbers, and elliptic curve cryptography relies on the difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem for elliptic curves. However, the continual increase in the power of computers threatens the security of these systems, and so cryptographic systems have to keep adapting to the newest technology. For example, Shor's Algorithm (which could run on a quantum computer) can solve the public key cryptographic systems that rely on the integer factorization problem or the discrete logarithm problem. So if a working quantum computer was ever developed, it would threaten the existing cryptographic systems. Lattice-based cryptography is a potential source of systems that may be secure even in such an environment. The security of these systems is dependent on the fact that the average case of the difficulty of certain problems in lattice theory is higher than the worst case problems that underpin current cryptosystems. As we will see later in this section, lattices are built on bases for subspace of <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{.}\)</span></p>
