<p>Consider a planet orbiting the sun (or an object like a satellite orbiting the Earth). According to Kepler's Laws, we assume an elliptical orbit. There are many different ways to describe this orbit, and which description we use depends on our perspective and the application. One important perspective is to make the description of the orbit as simple as possible for earth-based observations. Two problems arise. One is that the earth's orbit and the orbit of the planet do not lie in the same plane. A second problem is that it is complicated to describe the orbit of a planet using the perspective of the plane of the earth's orbit. A reasonable approach, then, is to establish two different coordinate systems, one for the earth's orbit and one for the planet's orbit. We can then use a change of basis to move back and forth from these two perspectives.</p>
