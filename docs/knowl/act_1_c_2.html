<div class="introduction"><p>We have seen examples of systems with no solutions, one solution, and infinitely many solutions. As we will see in this activity, we can recognize the number of solutions to a system by analyzing the pivot positions in the augmented matrix of the system.</p></div>

<p>Write an example of an augmented matrix in row echelon form so that the last column of the (whole) matrix is a pivot column. What is the system of equations corresponding to your augmented matrix? How many solutions does your system have? Why?</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>
<p>Consider the reduced row echelon form <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_Ex_rref.html" title="Equation 3.2">(3.2)</a>. Based on the columns of this matrix, explain how we know that the system it represents is consistent.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h5>
<p>The system with reduced row echelon form <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_Ex_rref.html" title="Equation 3.2">(3.2)</a> is consistent. What is it about the columns of the coefficient matrix that tells us that this system has infinitely many solutions?</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h5>
