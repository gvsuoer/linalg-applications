<p>The matrix <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> that we constructed in problem (1) allows us to quickly and easily switch from coordinates with respect to a basis <span class="process-math">\(\CB\)</span> to coordinates with respect to another basis <span class="process-math">\(\CC\text{,}\)</span> providing a way to effectively transition from one coordinate system to another as described in the introduction. This matrix <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is called a <dfn class="terminology">change of basis matrix</dfn>. In problem (1) we explained why the change of basis matrix exists, and in this problem we will see another perspective from which to view this matrix. Let <span class="process-math">\(\CB = \{\vb_1, \vb_2\}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\CC = \{\vc_1, \vc_2\}\)</span> be two bases for <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> (not the specific bases we used earlier in this activity, but any bases). The change of basis matrix <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(\CB\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\CC\)</span> has the property that <span class="process-math">\(P[\vx]_{\CB} = [\vx]_{\CC}\)</span> for every vector <span class="process-math">\(\vx\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\text{.}\)</span> We can determine the entries of <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> by applying this formula to specific vectors in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\text{.}\)</span></p>
