<p>The approach we will take to connecting area (volume) to the determinant will help shed light on properties of the determinant that we will discuss from an algebraic perspective in a later section. First, we mention some basic properties of area (we focus on area for now, but these same properties are valid for volumes as well). volume). As a shorthand, we denote the area of a region <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(\Area(R)\text{.}\)</span></p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Area cannot be negative.</p></li>
<li><p>If two regions <span class="process-math">\(R_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(R_2\)</span> don't overlap, then the area of the union of the regions is equal to the sum of the areas of the regions. That is, if <span class="process-math">\(R_1 \cap R_2 = \emptyset\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(\Area(R_1 \cup R_2) = \Area(R_1) + \Area(R_2)\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p>Area is invariant under translation. That is, if we move a geometric region by the same amount uniformly in a given direction, the area of the original region and the area of the transformed region are the same. A translation of a region is done by just adding a fixed vector to each vector in the region. That is, a translation by a vector <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> is a function <span class="process-math">\(T_{\vv}\)</span> such that the image <span class="process-math">\(T_{\vv}(R)\)</span> of a region <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is defined as</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
T_{\vv}(R) = \{\vr+\vv : \vr \in R\}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Since area is translation invariant, <span class="process-math">\(\Area(T_{\vv}(R)) = \Area(R)\text{.}\)</span></p>
</li>
<li><p>The area of a one-dimensional object like a line segment is <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
