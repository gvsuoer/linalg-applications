<p>This text is formatted into sections, each of which contains preview activities, in-class activities, worked examples, and exercises. Most sections conclude with an application project — an application of the material in the section. The various types of activities serve different purposes.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Preview activities are designed for students to complete before class to motivate the upcoming topic and prepare them with the background and information they need for the class activities and discussion.</p></li>
<li><p>We generally use the regular activities to engage students during class in critical thinking experiences. These activities are used to provide motivation for the material, opportunities for students to develop course material on their own, or examples to help reinforce the meanings of definitions or theorems. The ultimate goal is to help students develop their intuition for and understanding of linear algebra concepts.</p></li>
<li><p>Worked examples are included in each section. Part of the philosophy of this text is that students will develop the tools and understanding they need to work homework assignments through the preview, in-class activities, and class discussions. But some students express a desire for fully-worked examples in the text to reference during homework. In order to preserve the flow of material within a section, we include worked examples at the end of each section.</p></li>
<li><p>The suggestion by the Linear Algebra Curriculum Study Group (LACSG) that, “Mathematics departments should seriously consider making their first course in linear algebra a matrix-oriented course.” is followed in this text. They suggest that this approach “implies less emphasis on abstraction and more emphasis on problem solving and motivating applications.” and that “Some applications of linear algebra should be included to give an indication of the pervasive use of linear algebra in many client disciplines. Such applications necessarily will be limited by the need to minimize technical jargon and information from outside the course. Students should see the course as one of the most potentially useful mathematics courses they will take as an undergraduate.” The focus of this text for the first two semesters of linear algebra (Sections 1 through 27) is on <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{,}\)</span> and applications of linear algebra in real spaces. At our institution, these sections comprise a two-semester entry-level sequence into our major, suitable for freshmen without a calculus prerequisite. Abstract vector spaces do not appear until Section 28, which we consider to be the beginning of a third semester of linear algebra, a junior or senior level mathematics course. Also, the 2015 Committee on the Undergraduate Program in Mathematics (CUPM) report to the Mathematical Association of America recommends that “Every Linear Algebra course should incorporate interesting applications, both to highlight the broad usefulness of linear algebra and to help students see the role of the theory in the subject as it is applied. Attractive applications may also entice students majoring in other disciplines to choose a minor or additional major in mathematics.” All but two sections in this text include a substantial application. Each section begins with a short description of an application that uses the material from the section, then concludes with a project that develops the application in more detail. (The two sections that do not include projects are sections that are essentially long proofs — one section that contains formal proofs of the equivalences of the different parts of the Invertible Matrix Theorem, and the other contains algebraic proofs of the properties of the determinant.) The projects are independent of the material in the text — the text can be used without the applications. The applications are written in such a way that they could also be used with other textbooks. The projects are written following an inquiry-based style similar to the text, with important parts of the applications developed through activities. So the projects can be assigned outside of class as independent work for students. Several of the projects are accompanied by GeoGebra applets or Sage worksheets which are designed to help the students better understand the applications.</p></li>
<li><p>Each investigation contains a collection of exercises. The exercises occur at a variety of levels of difficulty and most force students to extend their knowledge in different ways. While there are some standard, classic problems that are included in the exercises, many problems are open ended and expect a student to develop and then verify conjectures.</p></li>
