<p>Now we assume we have a planet (different from the earth) orbiting the sun and we establish how to convert back and forth from the coordinate system of earth's orbit to the coordinate system of the planet's orbit. To do so we need to establish some coordinate systems. We assume the orbit of earth is in the standard <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span> plane, with the sun (one of the foci) at the origin. The elliptical orbit of the planet is in some other plane with coordinate axes <span class="process-math">\(x'\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y'\text{.}\)</span> The two orbital planes intersect in a line. Let this line be the <span class="process-math">\(x'\)</span> axis and let <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> be the angle the positive <span class="process-math">\(x'\)</span> axis makes with the positive <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> axis. We can represent the elliptical orbit of the planet in the <span class="process-math">\(x'y'\)</span> plane, but the <span class="process-math">\(x'\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y'\)</span> axes are not likely to be the best axes for this orbit. So we define a third coordinate system <span class="process-math">\(x''y''\)</span> in the <span class="process-math">\(x'y'\)</span> plane so that the origin (the position of the sun) is at one focus of the planet's orbit and the <span class="process-math">\(x''\)</span> axis is the major axis of the orbit and the <span class="process-math">\(y''\)</span> axis is the minor axis of the orbit of the planet. The unit vectors <span class="process-math">\(\vb_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vb_2\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vb_3\)</span> in the positive <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> directions define a basis <span class="process-math">\(\CB = \{\vb_1, \vb_2, \vb_3\}\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\text{,}\)</span> the unit vectors <span class="process-math">\(\vb'_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vb'_2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vb'_3\)</span> in the positive <span class="process-math">\(x'\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(y'\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(z'\)</span> directions define a basis <span class="process-math">\(\CB' = \{\vb'_1, \vb'_2, \vb'_3\}\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\text{,}\)</span> and the unit vectors <span class="process-math">\(\vb''_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vb''_2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vb''_3\)</span> in the positive <span class="process-math">\(x''\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(y''\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(z''\)</span> directions define a basis <span class="process-math">\(\CB'' = \{\vb''_1, \vb''_2, \vb''_3\}\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\text{.}\)</span> See <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_orbits.html" title="Figure 16.11">FigureÂ 16.11</a> for illustrations.</p>
