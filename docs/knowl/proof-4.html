<dd><p>This was done in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act_2_d_1.html" title="Activity 11.2">Activity 11.2</a>.</p></dd>
<dt>Statement (3) implies Statement (4)</dt>
<dd><p>Suppose that every column of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is a pivot column. The fact that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is square means that every row of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> contains a pivot, and hence the columns of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> span <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{.}\)</span></p></dd>
<dt>Statement (4) implies Statement (5)</dt>
<dd><p>Since the columns of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> span <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{,}\)</span> it must be the case that every row of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> contains a pivot. This means that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> must be row equivalent to <span class="process-math">\(I_n\text{.}\)</span></p></dd>
<dt>Statement (5) implies Statement (6)</dt>
<dd><p>If <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is row equivalent to <span class="process-math">\(I_n\text{,}\)</span> there must be a pivot in every column, which means that the columns of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> are linearly independent.</p></dd>
<dt>Statement (6) implies Statement (7)</dt>
<dd><p>If the columns of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> are linearly independent, then there is a pivot in every column. Since <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is a square matrix, there is a pivot in every row as well. So the columns of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> span <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{.}\)</span> Since they are also linearly independent, the columns form a minimal spanning set, which is a basis of <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{.}\)</span></p></dd>
<dt>Statement (7) implies Statement (8)</dt>
<dd><p>If the columns form a basis of <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{,}\)</span> then the columns are linearly independent. This means that each column is a pivot column, which also implies <span class="process-math">\(A\vx=\vzero\)</span> has a unique solution and that <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is one-to-one.</p></dd>
<dt>Statement (8) implies Statement (9)</dt>
<dd><p>If <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is one-to-one, then <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> has a pivot in every column. Since <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is square, every row of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> contains a pivot. Therefore, the system <span class="process-math">\(A \vx = \vb\)</span> is consistent for every <span class="process-math">\(\vb \in \R^n\)</span> and has a unique solution.</p></dd>
<dt>Statement (9) implies Statement (10)</dt>
<dd><p>If <span class="process-math">\(A\vx=\vb\)</span> has a unique solution for every <span class="process-math">\(\vb\text{,}\)</span> then the transformation <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is onto since <span class="process-math">\(T(\vx)=\vb\)</span> has a solution for every <span class="process-math">\(\vb\text{.}\)</span></p></dd>
<dt>Statement (10) implies Statement (11)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Assume that <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> defined by <span class="process-math">\(T(\vx) = A\vx\)</span> is onto. For each <span class="process-math">\(i\text{,}\)</span> let <span class="process-math">\(\ve_i\)</span> be the <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span>th column of the <span class="process-math">\(n \times n\)</span> identity matrix <span class="process-math">\(I_n\text{.}\)</span> That is, <span class="process-math">\(\ve_i\)</span> is the vector in <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> with 1 in the <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span>th component and 0 everywhere else. Since <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is onto, for each <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> there is a vector <span class="process-math">\(\vc_i\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(T(\vc_i) = A \vc_i = \ve_i\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(C = [\vc_1  \ \vc_2 \ \cdots \ \vc_n]\text{.}\)</span> Then</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
AC = A[\vc_1  \ \vc_2 \ \cdots \ \vc_n] = [A\vc_1 \ A\vc_2 \ \cdots \ A\vc_n] = [\ve_1 \ \ve_2 \ \cdots \ \ve_n] = I_n\text{.}

<dt>Statement (11) implies Statement (12)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Assume <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is an <span class="process-math">\(n \times n\)</span> matrix so that <span class="process-math">\(AC = I_n\text{.}\)</span> First we show that the matrix equation <span class="process-math">\(C \vx = \vzero\)</span> has only the trivial solution. Suppose <span class="process-math">\(C \vx = \vzero\text{.}\)</span> Then multiplying both sides on the left by <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> gives us</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
A(C \vx) = A \vzero\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Simplifying this equation using <span class="process-math">\(AC=I_n\text{,}\)</span> we find <span class="process-math">\(\vx = \vzero\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(C \vx = \vzero\)</span> has only the trivial solution, every column of <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> must be a pivot column. Since <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is an <span class="process-math">\(n \times n\)</span> matrix, it follows that every row of <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> contains a pivot position. Thus, the matrix equation <span class="process-math">\(C \vx = \vb\)</span> is consistent and has a unique solution for every <span class="process-math">\(\vb\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(\vv_i\)</span> be the vector in <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> satisfying <span class="process-math">\(C \vv_i = \ve_i\)</span> for each <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> between 1 and <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> and let <span class="process-math">\(M = [\vv_1 \ \vv_2 \ \cdots \ \vv_n]\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(CM = I_n\text{.}\)</span> Now we show that <span class="process-math">\(CA = I_n\text{.}\)</span> Since</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
AC = I_n
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">we can multiply both sides on the left by <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> to see that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
C(AC) = CI_n\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Now we multiply both sides on the right by <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> and obtain</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
(C(AC))M = CM\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Using the associative property of matrix multiplication and the fact that <span class="process-math">\(CM = I_n\)</span> shows that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
(CA)(CM) \amp = CM\\
CA = I_n\text{.}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Thus, if <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> are <span class="process-math">\(n \times n\)</span> matrices and <span class="process-math">\(AC = I_n\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(CA = I_n\text{.}\)</span> So we have proved our implication with <span class="process-math">\(D = C\)</span></p>
</dd>
<dt>Statement (12) implies Statement (13)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Assume that there is an <span class="process-math">\(n \times n\)</span> matrix <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(DA = I_n\text{.}\)</span> Suppose <span class="process-math">\(A \vx = \vzero\text{.}\)</span> Then multiplying both sides by <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> on the left, we find that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
D(A\vx) \amp = D\vzero\\
(DA) \vx \amp = \vzero\\
\vx \amp = \vzero\text{.}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">So the equation <span class="process-math">\(A \vx = \vzero\)</span> has only the trivial solution and <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> is not an eigenvalue for <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span></p>
</dd>
<dt>Statement (13) implies Statement (14)</dt>
<dd>
<p>If 0 is not an eigenvalue of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> then the equation <span class="process-math">\(A \vx = \vzero\)</span> has only the trivial solution. Since <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/item_trivial_soln.html" title="Item 2">statement 2</a> implies <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/item_AC_I.html" title="Item 11">statement 11</a>, there is an <span class="process-math">\(n \times n\)</span> matrix <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(AC = I_n\text{.}\)</span> The proof that <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/item_AC_I.html" title="Item 11">statement 11</a> implies <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/item_DA_I.html" title="Item 12">statement 12</a> shows that <span class="process-math">\(CA = I_n\)</span> as well. So <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is invertible. By taking the transpose of both sides of the equation <span class="process-math">\(AA^{-1}=A^{-1}A=I_n\)</span> (remembering <span class="process-math">\((AB)^{\tr}= B^{\tr}A^{\tr}\)</span>) we find</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
(A^{-1})^{\tr} A^{\tr} = A^{\tr} (A^{-1})^{\tr} = I_n^{\tr}=I_n \,\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Therefore, <span class="process-math">\((A^{-1})^{\tr}\)</span> is the inverse of <span class="process-math">\(A^{\tr}\)</span> by definition of the inverse.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Statement (14) implies Statement (1)</dt>
<dd><p>Since statement (1) implies statement (14), we proved ‘If <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is invertible, then <span class="process-math">\(A^{\tr}\)</span> is invertible.’' Using this implication with <span class="process-math">\(A^{\tr}\)</span> replaced by <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> we find that ‘If <span class="process-math">\(A^{\tr}\)</span> is invertible, then <span class="process-math">\((A^{\tr})^{\tr}\)</span> is invertible.’' But <span class="process-math">\((A^{\tr})^{\tr}=A\text{,}\)</span> which proves that statement (14) implies statement (1).</p></dd>
