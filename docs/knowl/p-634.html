<p>As we saw in the previous section, the question of whether a system of linear equations has a solution is equivalent to the question of whether the vector obtained by the non-coefficient constants in the system is a linear combination of the vectors obtained from the columns of the coefficient matrix of the system. So if we were interested in finding for which constants the system has a solution, we would look for the collection of all linear combinations of the columns. We call this collection the <dfn class="terminology">span</dfn> of these vectors. In this section we investigate the concept of span both algebraically and geometrically.</p>
