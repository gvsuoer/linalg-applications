<body class="ignore-math"><div class="fn">The Internet is very large and has upwards of 25 billion pages. This would leave us with an enormous transition matrix, even though most of its entries are 0. In fact, studies show that web pages have an average of about 10 links, so on average all but 10 entries of each column are 0. Working with such a large matrix is beyond what we want to do in this project, so we will just amuse ourselves with small examples that illustrate the general points.</div></body>
