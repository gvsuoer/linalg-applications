<p>For the majority of this text, we will work with real vectors. However, a vector does not need to be restricted to have real entries. At times we will use complex vectors and even vectors in other types of sets. The types of sets we use will be ones that have structure just like the real numbers. Recall that a real number is a number that has a decimal representation, either finite or repeating (rational numbers) or otherwise (irrational numbers). We can add and multiply real numbers as we have done throughout our mathematical careers, and the real numbers have a certain structure given in the following theorem that we will treat as an axiom â€” that is, we assume these properties without proof. We denote the set of real numbers with the symbol <span class="process-math">\(\R\text{.}\)</span></p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="chap_vector_representation.html#paragraphs-12" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
