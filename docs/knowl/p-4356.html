<p>There are three main ways to compute a QR decomposition.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>The method discussed in this section uses Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. This method is not recommended for numerical use as it is inherently numerically unstable. Under certain circumstances, cancellation can destroy the accuracy of the computed vectors and the resulting vectors may not be orthogonal.</p></li>
<li><p>The method that we will discuss in this project using Householder transformations (developed by Alston S. Householder). In Gaussian elimination, we can zero out entries below the diagonal by multiplying by elementary matrices to perform row operations. Householder transformations do something similar, allowing us to replace columns with columns of mostly zeros, which then allow for more efficient computations.</p></li>
<li><p>Givens (or Jacobi) rotations (used by W. Givens and originally invented by Jacobi for use with in solving the symmetric eigenvalue problem) is another method that allows us to selectively produce zeros into a matrix. We will focus on Householder transformations in this project.</p></li>
