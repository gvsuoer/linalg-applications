<p>We assume that there is a way for balls to move from one bin to the other (like having gas molecules pass through a permeable membrane). A way to think about this is that we select a ball (from ball 1 to ball 4, which are different balls) and move that ball from its current bin to the other bin. Consider a “move” to be any instance when a ball changes bins. A <dfn class="terminology">state</dfn> is any configuration of balls in the bins at a given time, and the state changes when a ball is chosen at random and moved to the other bin. The possible states are to have 0 balls in Bin 1 and 4 balls in Bin 2 (State 0, entropy 1), 1 ball in Bin 1 and 3 in Bin 2 (State 1, entropy 4), 2 balls in each Bin (State 2, entropy 6), 3 balls in Bin 1 and 1 ball in Bin 2 (State 3, entropy 4), and 4 balls in Bin 1 and 0 balls in Bin 2 (State 4, entropy 1). These states are shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_Ehrenfest.html" title="Figure 18.10">Figure 18.10</a>.</p>
