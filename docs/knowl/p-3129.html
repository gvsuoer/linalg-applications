<p>To realistically model the diffusion of gas molecules we would need to consider a system with a large number of balls as substitutes for the gas molecules. However, the main idea can be seen in a model with a much smaller number of balls, as we will do now. Suppose we have two bins that contain a total of <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> balls between them. Label the bins as Bin 1 and Bin 2. In this case we can think of entropy as the number of different possible ways the balls can be arranged in the system. For example, there is only <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> way for all of the balls to be in Bin 1 (low entropy), but there are <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> ways that we can have one ball in Bin 1 (choose any one of the four different balls, which can be distinguished from each other) and <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> balls in Bin 2 (higher entropy). The highest entropy state has the balls equally distributed between the bins (with <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> different ways to do this).</p>
