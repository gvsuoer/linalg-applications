<p>In essence, a coordinate transformation makes an identification of any vector space of dimension <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{.}\)</span> One of the driving forces behind this identification is the fact that, just as in <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{,}\)</span> if a vector space <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> has a basis of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> elements, then any basis for <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> will have exactly <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> elements. The fact that any coordinate transformation from a vector space <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> is linear means that elements in <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> behave the same way with respect to addition and multiplication by scalars in <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> as do their images in <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> under the coordinate transformation. To make this identification complete, there are still two questions to address. First, given a coordinate transformation <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> from a vector space <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{,}\)</span> is is possible for two vectors in <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> to have the same image in <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> (in other words, is <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> one-to-one), and is every vector in <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> the image of some vector in <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> under <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> (in other words, does <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> map <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> onto <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span>)? If the coordinate transformations are one-to-one and onto, then, in essence, any vector space of dimension <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is just a copy of <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{.}\)</span> As a result, to understand any vector space with a basis of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> vectors, it is enough to understand <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{.}\)</span></p>
