<p>Accurately predicting the weather has long been an important task. Meteorologists use science, mathematics, and technology to construct models that help us understand weather patterns. These models are very sophisticated, but we will consider only a simple model. Suppose, for example, we want to learn something about whether it will be wet or dry in Grand Rapids, Michigan. To do this, we might begin by collecting some data about weather conditions in Grand Rapids and then use that to make predictions. Information taken over the course of 2017 from the National Weather Service Climate Data shows that if it was dry (meaning no measurable precipitation, either rain or snow) on a given day in Grand Rapids, it would be dry the next day with a probability of 64% and wet with a probability of 36%. Similarly, if it was wet on a given day it would be dry the next day with a probability of 47% and dry with a probability of 53%. Assuming that this pattern is one that continues in the long run, we can develop a mathematical model to make predictions about the weather.</p>
