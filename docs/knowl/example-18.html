<div class="introduction">
<p>Accurately predicting the weather has long been an important task. Meteorologists use science, mathematics, and technology to construct models that help us understand weather patterns. These models are very sophisticated, but we will consider only a simple model. Suppose, for example, we want to learn something about whether it will be wet or dry in Grand Rapids, Michigan. To do this, we might begin by collecting some data about weather conditions in Grand Rapids and then use that to make predictions. Information taken over the course of 2017 from the National Weather Service Climate Data shows that if it was dry (meaning no measurable precipitation, either rain or snow) on a given day in Grand Rapids, it would be dry the next day with a probability of 64% and wet with a probability of 36%. Similarly, if it was wet on a given day it would be dry the next day with a probability of 47% and dry with a probability of 53%. Assuming that this pattern is one that continues in the long run, we can develop a mathematical model to make predictions about the weather.</p>
<p>This data tells us how the weather transitions from one day to the next, and we can succinctly represent this data in a <dfn class="terminology">transition matrix</dfn>:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation}
T = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 0.64\amp 0.47 \\ 0.36\amp 0.53 \end{array}  \right]\text{.}\tag{9.5}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p>Whether it is dry or wet on a given day is called the <dfn class="terminology">state</dfn> of that day. So our transition matrix tells us about the transition between states. Notice that if <span class="process-math">\(T = [t_{ij}]\text{,}\)</span> then the probability of moving from state <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span> to state <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> is given by <span class="process-math">\(t_{ij}\text{.}\)</span> We can represent a state by a vector: the vector <span class="process-math">\(\left[ \begin{array}{c} 1\\0 \end{array} \right]\)</span> represents the dry state and the vector <span class="process-math">\(\left[ \begin{array}{c} 0\\1 \end{array} \right]\)</span> represents the wet state.</p>

<p>We can use the transition matrix to build a chain of probability vectors. We begin with an initial state, say it is dry on a given day.
