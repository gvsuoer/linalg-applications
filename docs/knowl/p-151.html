<p>To justify that there are examples of something happening or not happening, one would need to give a specific example. For example, in justifying the claim that there is a system of two equations in two unknowns with infinitely many solutions, it is not enough to say “An equation in two unknowns is a line in the <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span>-plane, so there can be two equations with the same line as their solution.” In general, you should avoid the words “can,” “possibly,” “maybe,” etc., in your justifications. Instead, giving an example such as “The linear system <span class="process-math">\(x+y=1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(2x+2y=2\)</span> of two equations in two unknowns has infinitely many solutions since the second equation gives the same line as the first in the <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span>-plane.” provides complete justification beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
