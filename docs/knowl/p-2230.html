<p>Here we argue that the method described following <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act_3_b_3.html" title="Activity 13.4">ActivityÂ 13.4</a> to find a spanning set for the null space always yields a basis for the null space. First note that <span class="process-math">\(\Nul R = \Nul A\text{,}\)</span> since the system <span class="process-math">\(A\vx = \vzero\)</span> has the same solution set as <span class="process-math">\(R \vx = \vzero\text{.}\)</span> So it is enough to find a basis for <span class="process-math">\(\Nul R\text{.}\)</span> If every column of <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is a pivot column, then <span class="process-math">\(R \vx = \vzero\)</span> has only the trivial solution and the null space of <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(\{ \vzero \}\text{.}\)</span> Let us now consider the case where <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> contains non-pivot columns. If we let <span class="process-math">\(\vx = [x_1 \ x_2 \ \ldots \ x_n]^{\tr}\text{,}\)</span> and if <span class="process-math">\(R\vx = \vzero\)</span> then we can write <span class="process-math">\(x_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x_2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\ldots\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x_{n-k}\)</span> in terms of <span class="process-math">\(x_{n-k+1}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x_{n-k+2}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\ldots\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_n\text{.}\)</span> From these equations we can write <span class="process-math">\(\vx\)</span> as a linear combination of some vectors <span class="process-math">\(\vv_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vv_2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\ldots\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vv_k\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(x_{n-k+1}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x_{n-2+2}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\ldots\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x_n\)</span> as weights. By construction, each of the vectors <span class="process-math">\(\vv_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vv_2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\ldots\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vv_k\)</span> has a component that is 1 with the corresponding component as 0 in all the other <span class="process-math">\(\vv_i\text{.}\)</span> Therefore, the vectors <span class="process-math">\(\vv_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vv_2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\ldots\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vv_k\)</span> are linearly independent and span <span class="process-math">\(\Nul R\)</span> (and <span class="process-math">\(\Nul A\)</span>). In other words, the method we have developed to find the general solution to <span class="process-math">\(A \vx = \vzero\)</span> always produces a basis for <span class="process-math">\(\Nul A\text{.}\)</span></p>
