<p>Before analyzing a data set there is often some initial preparation that needs to be made. Issues that have to be dealt with include the problem that attributes might have different units and scales. For example, in a data set with attributes about people, height could be measured in inches while weight is measured in pounds. It is difficult to compare variables when they are on different scales. Another issue to consider is that some attributes are independent of the others (height, for example does not depend on hair color), while some are interrelated (body mass index depends on height and weight). To simplify our work, we will not address these type of problems. The only preparation we will do with our data is to center it.</p>
