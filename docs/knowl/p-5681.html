<p>To process a signal we select a family of wavelets. There are many different families of wavelets â€” which family to use depends on the problem to be addressed. The simplest family of wavelets is the Haar family. More complicated families of wavelets are usually used in applications, but the basic ideas in wavelets can be seen through working with the Haar wavelets, and their relative simplicity will make the details easier to follow. Each family of wavelets has a father wavelet (usually denoted <span class="process-math">\(\varphi\)</span>) and a mother wavelet (<span class="process-math">\(\psi\)</span>).</p>
