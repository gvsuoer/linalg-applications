<div class="introduction">
<p>Suppose that there are three base stations <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> that can send and receive signals from your mobile phone. Assume that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is located at point <span class="process-math">\((-1,-2)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> at point <span class="process-math">\((36,5)\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> at point <span class="process-math">\((16,35)\text{.}\)</span> Also assume that your mobile phone location is point <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\text{.}\)</span> Based on the time that it takes to receive the signals from the three base stations, it can be determined that your distance to base station <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(28\)</span> km, your distance to base station <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(26\)</span> km, and your distance to base station <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(14\)</span> km using a coordinate system with measurements in kilometers based on a reference point chosen to be <span class="process-math">\((0,0)\text{.}\)</span> Due to limitations on the measurement equipment, these measurements all contain some unknown error which we will denote as <span class="process-math">\(z\text{.}\)</span> The goal is to determine your location in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> based on this information.</p>
<p>If the distance readings were accurate, then the point <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\)</span> would lie on the circle centered at <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> of radius <span class="process-math">\(29\text{.}\)</span> The distance from <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\)</span> to base station <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> can be represented in two different ways: <span class="process-math">\(28\)</span> km and <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{(x+1)^2 + (y+2)^2}\text{.}\)</span> However, there is some error in the measurements (due to the receiver clock and satellite clocks not being snychronized), so we really have</p>

<p>If all measurements were accurate, your position would be at the intersection of the circles centered at <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> with radius <span class="process-math">\(28\)</span> km, centered at <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> with radius <span class="process-math">\(26\)</span> km, and centered at <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> with radius <span class="process-math">\(14\)</span> km as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_GPS_circles.html" title="Figure 30.12">Figure 30.12</a>. Even though the figure might seem to imply it, because of the error in the measurements the three circles do not intersect in one point. So instead, we want to find the best estimate of a point of intersection that we can. The system of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_GPS_2D_1.html" title="Equation 30.11">equations (30.11)</a>, <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_GPS_2D_2.html" title="Equation 30.12">(30.12)</a>, and <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_GPS_2D_3.html" title="Equation 30.13">(30.13)</a> is non-linear and can be difficult to solve, if it even has a solution. To approximate a solution, we can linearize the system. To do this, show that if we subtract corresponding sides of equation  <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_GPS_2D_1.html" title="Equation 30.11">(30.11)</a> from <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_GPS_2D_2.html" title="Equation 30.12">(30.12)</a> and expand both sides, we can obtain the linear equation</p>
