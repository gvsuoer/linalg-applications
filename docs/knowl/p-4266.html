<p>There are several different factorizations, or decompositions, of matrices where each matrix is written as a product of certain types of matrices: LU decomposition using lower and upper triangular matrices (see <a href="chap_det_properties.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 22: Properties of Determinants">Chapter 22</a>), EVD (EigenVector Decomposition) decomposition using eigenvectors and diagonal matrices (see <a href="chap_diagonalization.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 19: Diagonalization">Chapter 19</a>), and in this section we will introduce the QR decomposition of a matrix. The QR decomposition is one of the most important tools for matrix computations. Jack Dongarra and Francis Sullivan<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-40-hidden.html" title="Footnote 40"><sup> 40 </sup></a> nominated the QR decomposition as one of the “10 algorithms with the greatest influence on the development and practice of science and engineering in the 20th century.” The QR algorithm's importance stems from the fact that is a “genuinely new contribution to the field of numerical analysis and not just a refinement of ideas given by Newton, Gauss, Hadamard, or Schur.”<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-41-hidden.html" title="Footnote 41"><sup> 41 </sup></a> Most computer algebra systems (e.g., MATLAB) use a variant of the QR decomposition to compute eigenvalues. While there are other methods for approximating eigenvalues, the QR algorithm stands out. For example, the power method is useful when a matrix is large and contains a lot of zero entries (such matrices are called <dfn class="terminology">sparse</dfn>). When most of the entries of a matrix are nonzero, the power method is not recommended. The better, more sophisticated, alternative in these situations is to use the QR decomposition. The QR factorization has applications to solving least squares problems and approximating eigenvalues of matrices.</p>
