<p><span class="booktitle">An Inquiry-Based Introduction to Linear Algebra and Applications</span> provides a novel inquiry-based learning approach to linear algebra, as well as incorporating aspects of an inverted classroom. The impetus for this book lies in our approach to teaching linear algebra. We place an emphasis on active learning and on developing students' intuition through their investigation of examples. For us, active learning involves students â€” they are DOING something instead of being passive learners. What students are doing when they are actively learning might include discovering, processing, discussing, applying information, writing intensive assignments, engaging in common intellectual in-class experiences or collaborative assignments and projects. Although it is difficult to capture the essence of active learning in a textbook, this book is our attempt to do just that.</p>
