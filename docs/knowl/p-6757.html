<p>A body in motion obeys Newton's second law that force equals mass times acceleration, or <span class="process-math">\(F = ma\text{.}\)</span> Here <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> is the force acting on the object, <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> the mass of the object, and <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> the acceleration of the object. For example, if a mass is hanging from a spring, gravity acts to pull the mass downward and the spring acts to pull the mass up. Hooke?s law says that the force of the spring acting on mass is proportional to the displacement <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> of the spring from equilibrium. There is also a damping force that weakens the action of the spring that might be due to air resistance or the medium in which the system is enclosed. If this mass is not too large, then the resistance can be taken to be proportional to the velocity <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> of the mass. This produces forces <span class="process-math">\(F = ma\)</span> acting to pull the mass down and forces <span class="process-math">\(-ky\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(- bv\)</span> acting in the opposite direction, where <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are constant. A similar type of analysis would apply to an object falling through the air, where the resistant to falling could be proportional to the velocity of the object. Since <span class="process-math">\(v = y'\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(a = y''\text{,}\)</span> equating the forces produces the equation'</p>
