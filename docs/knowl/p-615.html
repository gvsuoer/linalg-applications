<p>In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/pa_1_d.html" title="Preview Activity 4.1">Preview ActivityÂ 4.1</a>, we considered the sets of all scalar multiples of a single nonzero vector in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> and in <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\text{.}\)</span> We also considered the set of all sums of scalar multiples of two nonzero vectors. These results so far gives us an idea of geometrical descriptions of sets of vectors generated by one or two vectors. Oftentimes we are interested in what vectors can be made from a given collection of vectors. For example, suppose we have two different water-benzene-acetic acid chemical solutions, one with 40% water, 50% benzene and 10% acetic acid, the other with 52% water, 42% benzene and 6% acid. An experiment we want to conduct requires a chemical solution with 43% water, 48% benzene and 9% acid. We would like to know if we make this new chemical solution by mixing the first two chemical solutions, or do we have to run to the chemical solutions market to get the chemical solution we want.</p>
