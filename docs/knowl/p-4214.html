<p>MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) systems are widely used to increase data transmission rates and improve the quality of wireless communication systems. MIMO is one of several forms of smart antenna technology, and it makes use of multiple antennas at the transmitter to send signals and multiple antennas at the receiver to accept the signals. MIMO systems transmit the same data on multiple streams, which introduces redundancy into the system. MIMO systems can utilize bounced and reflected signals to actually improve signal strength. This is very useful in urban environments in the presence of large buildings and the absence of direct line-of-sight transmission. MIMO systems can transmit several information streams in parallel (known as spatial multiplexing), allowing for increased data transformation rates. The presence of multiple receiver antennas allows for greater reliability in the system.</p>
