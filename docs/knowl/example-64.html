<p>The space <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> of all vectors with <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> components is a vector space using the standard vector addition and multiplication by scalars. The zero element is the zero vector <span class="process-math">\(\vzero\)</span> whose components are all 0.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h4>
<p>The set <span class="process-math">\(\pol_1\)</span> of all polynomials of degree less than or equal to 1 with addition and scalar multiplication as defined earlier. Recall that <span class="process-math">\(\pol_1\)</span> is essentially the same as <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\text{.}\)</span></p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h4>
<p>The properties listed in the introduction for <span class="process-math">\(\pol_1\)</span> are equally true for the collection of all polynomials of degree less than or equal to some fixed number. We label as <span class="process-math">\(\pol_n\)</span> this set of all polynomials of degree less than or equal to <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> with the standard addition and scalar multiplication. Note that <span class="process-math">\(\pol_n\)</span> is essentially the same as <span class="process-math">\(\R^{n+1}\text{.}\)</span> More generally, the space <span class="process-math">\(\pol\)</span> of all polynomials is also a vector space with standard addition and scalar multiplication.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h4>
<p>As a subspace of <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{,}\)</span> the eigenspace of an <span class="process-math">\(n \times n\)</span> matrix corresponding to an eigenvalue <span class="process-math">\(\lambda\)</span> is a vector space.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(e)</span></h4>
<p>As a subspace of <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{,}\)</span> the null space of an <span class="process-math">\(m \times n\)</span> matrix is a vector space.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(f)</span></h4>
<p>As a subspace of <span class="process-math">\(\R^m\text{,}\)</span> the column space of an <span class="process-math">\(m \times n\)</span> matrix is a vector space.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(g)</span></h4>
<p>The span of a set of vectors in <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\)</span> is a subspace of <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{,}\)</span> and is therefore a vector space.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(h)</span></h4>
<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> be a vector space and let <span class="process-math">\(\vzero\)</span> be the additive identity in <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span> The set <span class="process-math">\(\{\vzero\}\)</span> is a vector space in which <span class="process-math">\(\vzero + \vzero = \vzero\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(k\vzero = \vzero\)</span> for any scalar <span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span> This space is called the <em class="emphasis">trivial</em> vector space.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(i)</span></h4>
<p>The space <span class="process-math">\(\M_{m \times n}\)</span> (or <span class="process-math">\(\M_{m \times n}(\R)\)</span> when it is important to indicate that the entries of our matrices are real numbers) of all <span class="process-math">\(m \times n\)</span> matrices with real entries with the standard addition and multiplication by scalars we have already defined. In this case, <span class="process-math">\(\M_{m \times n}\)</span> is essentially the same vector space as <span class="process-math">\(\R^{mn}\text{.}\)</span></p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(j)</span></h4>
<p>The space <span class="process-math">\(\F\)</span> of all functions from <span class="process-math">\(\R\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\R\text{,}\)</span> where we define the sum of two functions <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\F\)</span> as the function <span class="process-math">\(f+g\)</span> satisfying</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
(f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">for all real numbers <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> and the scalar multiple <span class="process-math">\(cf\)</span> of the function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> by the scalar <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> to be the function satisfying</p>

<p>The space <span class="process-math">\(\R^\infty\)</span> of all infinite real sequences <span class="process-math">\((x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots)\text{.}\)</span> We define addition and scalar multiplication termwise:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
(x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots) + (y_1, y_2, y_3, \ldots) = (x_1+y_1, x_2+y_2, x_3+y_3, \ldots) \,\text{,}

<p class="continuation">is a vector space. In addition, the set of convergent sequences inside <span class="process-math">\(\R^\infty\)</span> forms a vector space using this addition and multiplication by scalars (as we did in <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{,}\)</span> we will call this set of convergent sequences a subspace of <span class="process-math">\(\R^{\infty}\)</span>).</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(l)</span></h4>
<p>(For those readers who are familiar with differential equations). The set of solutions to a second order homogeneous differential equation forms a vector space under addition and scalar multiplication defined as in the space <span class="process-math">\(\F\)</span> above.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(m)</span></h4>
<p>The set of polynomials of positive degree in <span class="process-math">\(\pol_1\)</span> is not a vector space using the standard addition and multiplication by scalars in <span class="process-math">\(\pol_1\)</span> is not a vector space. Notice that <span class="process-math">\(t + (-t)\)</span> is not a polynomial of positive degree, and so this set is not closed under addition.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(n)</span></h4>
<p>The color space where each color is assigned an RGB (red, green, blue) coordinate between 0 and 255, with addition and scalar multiplication defined component-wise, however, does not define a vector space. The color space is not closed under either operation due to the color coordinates being integers ranging from 0 to 255.</p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_vec_space.html#example-64">in-context</a></span>
