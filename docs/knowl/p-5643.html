<p>We return to the problem of image compression introduced at the beginning of this section. The first step in the wavelet compression process is to digitize an image. There are two important ideas about digitalization to understand here: intensity levels and resolution. In grayscale image processing, it is common to think of 256 different intensity levels, or scales, of gray ranging from 0 (black) to 255 (white). A digital image can be created by taking a small grid of squares (called pixels) and coloring each pixel with some shade of gray. The resolution of this grid is a measure of how many pixels are used per square inch. An example of a 16 by 16 pixel picture of a flower was shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_Flower_1.html" title="Figure 32.1">FigureÂ 32.1</a>.</p>
