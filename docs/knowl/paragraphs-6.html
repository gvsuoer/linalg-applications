<p>The inquiry-based format of this book means that you can be in charge of your own learning. The guidance of your instructor and support of your fellow classmates can help you develop your understanding of the topic. Your learning will benefit best if you engage in the material by completing all preview and in-class activities in order to fully develop your own intuition and understanding of the material, which can be achieved only by reflecting on the ideas and concepts and communicating your reflections with others. Don't be afraid to ask questions or to be wrong at times, for this is how people learn. Good luck! We will be happy to hear your comments about the book.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="fm_preface.html#paragraphs-6" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
