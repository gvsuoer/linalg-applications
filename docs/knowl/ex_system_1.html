<p>Consider the following system of two linear equations in two unknowns, <span class="process-math">\(x_1, x_2\text{:}\)</span></p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{alignat*}{2}
2x_1  \amp {}-{}  \amp 3x_2   \amp = 0\\
x_1   \amp {}-{}   \amp x_2    \amp = 1\text{.}
\end{alignat*}
</div>
<p>One way to solve such a system of linear equations is the method of substitution (where one equation is solved for one variable and then the resulting expression is substituted into the remaining equations). This method works well for simple systems of two equations in two unknowns, but becomes complicated if the number or complexity of the equations is increased.</p>
<p>Another method is elimination â€” the method that we will adopt in this book. Recall that the elimination method works by multiplying each equation by a suitable constant so that the coefficients of one of the variables in each equation is the same. Then we subtract corresponding sides of these equations to eliminate that variable.</p>
<p>Use the method of elimination to show that this system has the unique solution <span class="process-math">\(x_1=3\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_2=2\text{.}\)</span> Explain the specific steps you perform when using elimination.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="chap_intro_linear_systems.html#ex_system_1" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
