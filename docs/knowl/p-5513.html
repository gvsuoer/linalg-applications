<p>The advent of the digital age has presented many new opportunities for the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information. Along with these opportunities come new difficulties as well. All of this digital information must be stored in some way and be retrievable in an efficient manner. One collection of tools that is used to deal with these problems is wavelets. For example, the FBI fingerprint files contain millions of cards, each of which contains 10 rolled fingerprint impressions. Each card produces about 10 megabytes of data. To store all of these cards would require an enormous amount of space, and transmitting one full card over existing data lines is slow and inefficient. Without some sort of image compression, a sortable and searchable electronic fingerprint database would be next to impossible. To deal with this problem, the FBI adopted standards for fingerprint digitization using a wavelet compression standard.</p>
