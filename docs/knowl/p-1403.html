<p>The one property that might seem strange is the third one. To understand this property, suppose <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is an <span class="process-math">\(m \times n\)</span> matrix and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> an <span class="process-math">\(n \times k\)</span> matrix so that the product <span class="process-math">\(AB\)</span> is defined. We will argue that <span class="process-math">\((AB)^{\tr} = B^{\tr}A^{\tr}\)</span> by comparing the <span class="process-math">\(i,j\)</span>th entry of each side.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>First notice that the <span class="process-math">\(i,j\)</span>th entry of <span class="process-math">\((AB)^{\tr}\)</span> is the <span class="process-math">\(j,i\)</span>th entry of <span class="process-math">\(AB\text{.}\)</span> The <span class="process-math">\(j,i\)</span>th entry of <span class="process-math">\(AB\)</span> is found by taking the scalar product of the <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span>th row of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> with the <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span>th column of <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> Thus, the <span class="process-math">\(i,j\)</span>th entry of <span class="process-math">\((AB)^{\tr}\)</span> is the scalar product of the <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span>th row of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> with the <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span>th column of <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>The <span class="process-math">\(i,j\)</span>th entry of <span class="process-math">\(B^{\tr}A^{\tr}\)</span> is the scalar product of the <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span>th row of <span class="process-math">\(B^{\tr}\)</span> with the <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span>th column of <span class="process-math">\(A^{\tr}\text{.}\)</span> But the <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span>th row of <span class="process-math">\(B^{\tr}\)</span> is the <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span>th column of <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> and the <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span>th column of <span class="process-math">\(A^{\tr}\)</span> is the <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span>th row of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> So the <span class="process-math">\(i,j\)</span>th entry of <span class="process-math">\(B^{\tr}A^{\tr}\)</span> is the scalar product of the <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span>th row of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> with the <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span>th column of <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
