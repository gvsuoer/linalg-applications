<div class="introduction">
<p>In the method of elimination there are three operations we can apply to solve a system of linear equations. For this exercise we focus on a system of equations in three unknowns <span class="process-math">\(x_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x_2\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_3\text{,}\)</span> but the arguments generalize to a system with any number of variables. Consider the general system of three equations in three unknowns</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{alignat*}{3}
4x_1   \amp {}-{}  \amp 4x_2  \amp {}+{}  \amp 4x_3   \amp = 0\\
4x_1   \amp {}+{}  \amp 2x_2  \amp {}    \amp {}     \amp = 8\\
{}   \amp {}    \amp 2x_2  \amp {}+{}  \amp 5x_3  \amp = 9\text{.}
\end{alignat*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">The goal of this exercise is to understand why the three operations on a system do not change the solutions to the system. Recall that a solution to a system with unknowns <span class="process-math">\(x_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x_2\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_3\)</span> is a set of three numbers, one for <span class="process-math">\(x_1\text{,}\)</span> one for <span class="process-math">\(x_2\text{,}\)</span> and one for <span class="process-math">\(x_3\)</span> that satisfy all of the equations in the system.</p>
