<p>We end this project with a short discussion of fractal dimension. The fractals we have seen are very strange in many ways, one of which is dimension. We have studied the dimensions of subspaces of <span class="process-math">\(R^n\)</span> — each subspace has an integer dimension that is determined by the number of elements in a basis. Fractals also have a dimension, but the dimension of a fractal is generally not an integer. To try to understand fractal dimension, notice that a line segment is self-similar. We can break up a line segment into 2 non-overlapping line segments of the same length, or 3, or 4, or any number of non-overlapping segments of the same length. A square is slightly different. We can partition a square into 4 non-overlapping squares, or 9 non-overlapping squares, or <span class="process-math">\(n^2\)</span> non-overlapping squares for any positive integer <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_Squares.html" title="Figure 37.21">Figure 37.21</a>.</p>
