<div class="introduction"><p>Now we turn to the question of how to find the inverse of a matrix in general. With this approach, we will be able to determine which matrices have inverses as well. We will consider the <span class="process-math">\(2 \times 2\)</span> case to make the calculations easier. Suppose <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is a <span class="process-math">\(2 \times 2\)</span> matrix. Our goal is to find a matrix <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(AB = I_2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(BA = I_2\text{.}\)</span> If such a matrix exists, we will call <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> the inverse, <span class="process-math">\(A^{-1}\text{,}\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span></p></div>

<div class="introduction"><p>A matrix inverse is extremely useful in solving matrix equations and can help us in solving systems of equations. Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is an invertible matrix, i.e., there exists <span class="process-math">\(A^{-1}\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(AA^{-1}=A^{-1}A=I_n\text{.}\)</span></p></div>

<p>Consider the system <span class="process-math">\(A\vx=\vb\text{.}\)</span> Use the inverse of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to show that this system has a solution for every <span class="process-math">\(\vb\)</span> and find an expression for this solution in terms of <span class="process-math">\(\vb\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(A^{-1}\text{.}\)</span> (Note that since matrix multiplication is not commutative, we have to pay attention to the order in which we multiply matrices. For example, <span class="process-math">\(A^{-1}AB=B\)</span> while we cannot simplify <span class="process-math">\(ABA^{-1}\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> unless <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> commute.)</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(B)</span></h6>
<p>If <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> are matrices and <span class="process-math">\(A+C = B+C\text{,}\)</span> then we can subtract the matrix <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> from both sides to see that <span class="process-math">\(A = B\text{.}\)</span> We saw in <a href="chap_matrix_operations.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 8: Matrix Operations">ChapterÂ 8</a> that there is no corresponding general cancellation property for matrix multiplication when we found that <span class="process-math">\(AB=AC\)</span> could hold while <span class="process-math">\(B\neq C\text{.}\)</span> However, we can cancel <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> from this equation in certain circumstances. Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(AB=AC\)</span> and that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is an invertible matrix. Show that we can cancel <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> in this case and conclude that <span class="process-math">\(B=C\text{.}\)</span> (Note: When simplifying the product of matrices, again keep in mind that matrix multiplication is not commutative.)</p></article></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_inverse_intro.html#task-549">in-context</a></span>
