<p>To help students develop their communication skills in mathematics. We expect our students to read and complete activities before class and come prepared with questions. While in class, students work to discover many concepts on their own through guided activities. Of course, students also individually write solutions to exercises on which they receive significant feedback. Communication skills are essential in any discipline and we place a heavy focus on their development.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="fm_preface.html#li-3">in-context</a></span>
