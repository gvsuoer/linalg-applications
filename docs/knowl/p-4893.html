<p>If we want to incorporate the action of a matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> into a calculation of the norm of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> we might think of measuring how much <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> can change a vector <span class="process-math">\(\vx\text{.}\)</span> This could lead us to using <span class="process-math">\(||A\vx||\)</span> as some sort of measure of a norm of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> However, since <span class="process-math">\(||A (c\vx)|| = |c| \ ||A\vx||\)</span> for any scalar <span class="process-math">\(c\text{,}\)</span> scaling <span class="process-math">\(\vx\)</span> by a large scalar will produce a large norm, so this is not a viable definition of a norm. We could instead measure the <dfn class="terminology">relative</dfn> effect that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> has on a vector <span class="process-math">\(\vx\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(\ds \frac{||A\vx||}{||\vx||}\text{,}\)</span> since this ratio does not change when <span class="process-math">\(\vx\)</span> is multiplied by a scalar. The largest of all of these ratios would provide a good sense of how much <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> can change vectors. Thus, we define the operator norm of a matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> as follows.</p>
