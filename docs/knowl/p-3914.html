<p>When running a sprint, the racers may be aided or slowed by the wind. The wind assistance is a measure of the wind speed that is helping push the runners down the track. It is much easier to run a very fast race if the wind is blowing hard in the direction of the race. So that world records aren't dependent on the weather conditions, times are only recorded as record times if the wind aiding the runners is less than or equal to 2 meters per second. Wind speed for a race is recorded by a wind gauge that is set up close to the track. It is important to note, however, that weather is not always as cooperative as we might like. The wind does not always blow exactly in the direction of the track, so the gauge must account for the angle the wind makes with the track. If the wind is blowing in the direction of the vector <span class="process-math">\(\vu\)</span> in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_Projection.html" title="Figure 23.12">Figure 23.12</a> and the track is in the direction of the vector <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_Projection.html" title="Figure 23.12">Figure 23.12</a>, then only part of the total wind vector is actually working to help the runners. This part is called the orthogonal projection of the vector <span class="process-math">\(\vu\)</span> onto the vector <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> and is denoted <span class="process-math">\(\proj_{\vv} \vu\text{.}\)</span> The next activity shows how to find this projection.</p>
