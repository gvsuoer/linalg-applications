<p><a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act_limit.html" title="Project Activity 9.6">Project Activity 9.6</a> illustrates one problem with our seven page internet. The steady-state vector shows that page 3 is the only important page, but that hardly seems reasonable in the example since there are other pages that must have some importance. The problem is that page 3 is a “dangling” page and does not lead anywhere. Once a surfer reaches that page, they are stuck there, overemphasizing its importance. So this dangling page acts like a sink, ultimately drawing all surfers to it. To adjust for dangling pages, we make the assumption that if a surfer reaches a dangling page (one with no links emanating from it), the surfer will jump to any page on the web with equal probability. So in our seven page example, once a surfer reaches page 3 the surfer will jump to any page on the web with probability <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{7}\text{.}\)</span></p>
