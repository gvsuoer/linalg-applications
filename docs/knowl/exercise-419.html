<div class="introduction">
<p>Our entire world is always in a state of motion. Much of this motion is vibration. When the vibrations of one object some into contact with the vibrations of another, the vibrations can be amplified. This is called <dfn class="terminology">resonance</dfn>. Resonance appears in our lives every day, e.g., resonance is how food cooks in a microwave oven. A great example of resonance is the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge (just Google Tacoma Narrows Bridge to find some fascinating videos of this event). Resonance can be seen in mathematical models of vibrations. One such model is the second order differential equation</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
y'' + y = \cos(t)\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">where <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is some unknown function of <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y''\)</span> is its second derivative. You can think of this system as modeling the oscillatory motion of a spring with mass attached to it. The cosine function in this example exerts an external force on the mass-spring system. (You don't need to know how this model is derived for this project.) Our goal is to find the solutions to this differential equation within the subspace <span class="process-math">\(Y = \Span \ \CB\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(\CB = \{\cos(t), \sin(t),
t\cos(t), t\sin(t)\}\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(\D^2\text{,}\)</span> the subspace of <span class="process-math">\(\F\)</span> of functions with second derivatives (you may assume that <span class="process-math">\(\D^2\)</span> is a subspace of <span class="process-math">\(\F\)</span>). Let <span class="process-math">\(T: \D^2 \to \D^2\)</span> be defined by <span class="process-math">\(T(f) = f'' + f\text{.}\)</span></p>
