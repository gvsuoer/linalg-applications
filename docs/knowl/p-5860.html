<p>What is most important about covariance is its sign. Suppose <span class="process-math">\(\vy = [y_1 \ y_2 \ \ldots \ y_n]^{\tr}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vz = [z_1 \ z_2 \ \ldots \ z_n]^{\tr}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\cov(\vy,\vz) &gt; 0\text{.}\)</span> Then if <span class="process-math">\(y_i\)</span> is larger than <span class="process-math">\(y_j\)</span> it is likely that <span class="process-math">\(z_i\)</span> is also larger than <span class="process-math">\(z_j\text{.}\)</span> For example, if <span class="process-math">\(\vy\)</span> is a vector that records a persons height from age <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vz\)</span> records that same person's weight in the same years, we might expect that when <span class="process-math">\(y_i\)</span> increases so does <span class="process-math">\(z_i\text{.}\)</span> Similarly, if <span class="process-math">\(\cov(\vy,\vz) \lt 0\text{,}\)</span> then as one data set increases, the other decreases. As an example, if <span class="process-math">\(\vy\)</span> records the number of hours a student spends playing video games each semester ad <span class="process-math">\(\vz\)</span> gives the student's GPA for each semester, then we might expect that <span class="process-math">\(z_i\)</span> decreases as <span class="process-math">\(y_i\)</span> increases. When <span class="process-math">\(\cov(\vy,\vz) = 0\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(\vy\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vz\)</span> are said to be uncorrelated or independent of each other. For our example <span class="process-math">\(\vx_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vx_2\text{,}\)</span> what does <span class="process-math">\(\cov(\vx_1,\vx_2)\)</span> tell us about the relationship between <span class="process-math">\(\vx_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vx_2\text{?}\)</span> Why should we expect this from the context?</p>
