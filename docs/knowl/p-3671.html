<p>An elementary matrix <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> obtained by multiplying a row by <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> is a diagonal matrix with one <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> along the diagonal and the rest 1s, so <span class="process-math">\(\det(E) = r\text{.}\)</span> Similarly, an elementary matrix <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> obtained by adding a multiple of a row to another is a triangular matrix with 1s along the diagonal, so <span class="process-math">\(\det(E) = 1\text{.}\)</span> The fact that the the determinant of an elementary matrix obtained by swapping two rows is <span class="process-math">\(-1\)</span> is a bit more complicated and is verified independently later in this section. Also, the proof of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_4_f_2.html" title="Theorem 22.3">Theorem 22.3</a> depends on the fact that the cofactor expansion of a matrix is the same along any two rows. A proof of this can also be found later in this section.</p>
