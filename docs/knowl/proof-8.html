<p>Most proofs of this theorem require some results from topology. For that reason, we will not present a completely rigorous proof but rather give the highlights. Let <span class="process-math">\(A = [a_{ij}]\)</span> be an <span class="process-math">\(n \times n\)</span> matrix. Let <span class="process-math">\(D_i\)</span> be a collection of Gershgorin disks of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(1 \leq i \leq m\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(S = \cup_{1 \leq i \leq m} D_i\)</span> does not intersect any other Gershgorin disk of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> and let <span class="process-math">\(S'\)</span> be the union of the Gershgorin disks of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> that are different from the <span class="process-math">\(D_i\text{.}\)</span> Note that <span class="process-math">\(S \cap S' = \emptyset\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> be the matrix whose <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span>th column is <span class="process-math">\(a_{ii}\ve_i\text{,}\)</span> that is <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is the diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are the corresponding diagonal entries of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> Note that the eigenvalues of <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> are <span class="process-math">\(a_{ii}\)</span> and the Gershgorin disks of <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> are just the points <span class="process-math">\(a_{ii}\text{.}\)</span> So our theorem is true for this matrix <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span> To prove the result, we build a continuum of matrices from <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> as follows: let <span class="process-math">\(B = A-C\)</span> (so that <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is the matrix whose off-diagonal entries are those of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and whose diagonal entries are 0), and let <span class="process-math">\(A(t) = tB + C\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> in the interval <span class="process-math">\([0,1]\text{.}\)</span> Note that <span class="process-math">\(A(1) = A\text{.}\)</span> Since the diagonal entries of <span class="process-math">\(A(t)\)</span> are the same as those of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> the Gershgorin disks of <span class="process-math">\(A(t)\)</span> have the same centers as the corresponding Gershgorin disks of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> while the radii of the Gershgorin disks of <span class="process-math">\(A(t)\)</span> are those of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> but scaled by <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span> So the Gershgorin disks of <span class="process-math">\(A(t)\)</span> increase from points (the <span class="process-math">\(a_{ii}\)</span>) to the Gershgorin disks of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> increases from 0 to 1. While the centers of the disks all remain fixed, it is important to recognize that the eigenvalues of <span class="process-math">\(A(t)\)</span> move as <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> changes. An illustration of this is shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_Gershgorin_2.html" title="Figure 21.9">FigureÂ 21.9</a> with the eigenvalues as the black points and the changing Gershgorin disks dashed in magenta, using the matrix <span class="process-math">\(\left[ \begin{array}{cc} i\amp \frac{1}{2} \\ 1\amp -2+i \end{array} \right]\text{.}\)</span> We can learn about how the eigenvalues move with the characteristic polynomial.</p>

From topology, we know that since the disks <span class="process-math">\(D_i\)</span> are closed, the union <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> of these disks is also closed. Similarly, <span class="process-math">\(S(t)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(S'\)</span> are closed. Thus, <span class="process-math">\(\lambda(t)\)</span> is continuous in a closed set and so does not leave the set. Thus, <span class="process-math">\(\lambda(t)\)</span> is in <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> for every value of <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\([0,1]\text{.}\)</span></p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="chap_complex_eigenvalues.html#proof-8" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
