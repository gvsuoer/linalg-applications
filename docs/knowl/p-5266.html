<p>The game can be played with more players, and the problem is to find a strategy for the group that maximizes its chance of winning. One strategy is for a designated player to make a random guess and for the others to pass. This gives a 50% chance of winning. However, there are much better strategies that provide a nearly 100% probability of winning as the number of players increases. One such strategy is based on Hamming codes and subspaces of a particular vector space to implement the most effective approach.</p>
