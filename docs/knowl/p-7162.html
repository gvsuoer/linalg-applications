<p>Bailey begins by considering a community of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> persons who are susceptible to a disease, and supposes introducing a single infected individual into the community. Bailey makes the following assumptions: “We shall assume that the infection spreads by contact between the members of the community, and that it is not sufficiently serious for cases to be withdrawn from circulation by isolation or death; also that no case becomes clear of infection during the course of the main part of the epidemic.”</p>
