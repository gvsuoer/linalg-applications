<p>If a particle of mass <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> and velocity <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> is moving in a straight line, its kinetic energy <span class="process-math">\(KE\)</span> is given by <span class="process-math">\(KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2\text{.}\)</span> If, instead, the particle rotates around an axis with angular velocity <span class="process-math">\(\omega\)</span> (in radians per unit of time), its linear velocity is <span class="process-math">\(v = r \omega\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> is the radius of the particle's circular path. Substituting into the kinetic energy formula shows that the kinetic energy of the rotating particle is then <span class="process-math">\(KE = \frac{1}{2}\left(mr^2\right) \omega^2\text{.}\)</span> The quantity <span class="process-math">\(mr^2\)</span> is called the <dfn class="terminology">moment of inertia</dfn> of the particle and is denoted by <span class="process-math">\(I\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(KE = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2\)</span> for a rotating particle. Notice that the larger the value of <span class="process-math">\(r\text{,}\)</span> the larger the inertia. You can imagine this with a figure skater. When a skater spins along their major axis with their arms outstretched, the speed at which they rotate is lower than when they bring their arms into their bodies. The moment of inertia for rotational motion plays a role similar to the mass in linear motion. Essentially, the inertia tells us how resistant the particle is to rotation.</p>
