<p>Finding optimal solutions to systems is an important problem in applied mathematics. It is often the case that we cannot find an exact solution that satisfies certain constraints, so we look instead for the “best” solution that satisfies the constraints. An example of this is fitting a least squares line to a set of data. As we will see, the dot product will allow us to find “best” solutions to certain types of problems, where we measure accuracy using the notion of a distance between vectors. Geometrically, we can represent a vector <span class="process-math">\(\vu\)</span> as a directed line segment from the origin to the point defined by <span class="process-math">\(\vu\text{.}\)</span> If we have two vectors <span class="process-math">\(\vu\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vv\text{,}\)</span> we can think of the length of the difference <span class="process-math">\(\vu - \vv\)</span> as a measure of how far apart the two vectors are from each other. It is natural, then to define the distance between vectors as follows.</p>
