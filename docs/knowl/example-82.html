<div class="introduction"><p>We have shown that every linear transformation from a finite dimensional vector space <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> can be represented as a matrix transformation.

<p>From calculus, we know that the functions <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> that satisfy the equation <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = \frac{1}{\lambda} f'(x)\)</span> all have the form <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = Ae^{x/\lambda}\)</span> for some scalar <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> So if <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is an eigenvector of <span class="process-math">\(T\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = Ae^{x/\lambda}\)</span> for some scalar <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> Show, however, that <span class="process-math">\(Ae^{x/\lambda}\)</span> cannot be an eigenvector of <span class="process-math">\(T\text{.}\)</span> Thus, <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> has no eigenvectors with nonzero eigenvalues.</p>

<p>We can directly check from the definition that <span class="process-math">\(T(f)\)</span> is not a multiple of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=Ae^{x/\lambda}\)</span> unless <span class="process-math">\(A=0\text{,}\)</span> which is not allowed. Another method is to note that <span class="process-math">\(T(f)(0) = \int_0^0 f(t) \, dt = 0\)</span> by definition. But if <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = Ae^{x/\lambda}\text{,}\)</span> then</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
0 = T(f)(0) = \lambda f(0) = Ae^{0/\lambda} = A\text{.}

</div>
<p class="continuation">This means that  <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = 0e^{x/\lambda} = 0\text{.}\)</span> But <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> can never be an eigenvector by definition. So <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> has no eigenvectors with nonzero eigenvalues.</p>
</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h4>
<p>Now show that <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> is not an eigenvalue of <span class="process-math">\(T\text{.}\)</span> Conclude that <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> has no eigenvalues or eigenvectors.</p>

<p>Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> is an eigenvalue of <span class="process-math">\(T\text{.}\)</span> Then there is a nonzero function <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(T(g) = 0\text{.}\)</span> In other words, <span class="process-math">\(0 = \int_0^x g(t) \, dt\text{.}\)</span> Again, differentiating with respect to <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> yields the equation <span class="process-math">\(g(x) = 0\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> has no eigenvectors with eigenvalue <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> does not have a nonzero eigenvalue or zero as an eigenvalue, <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> has no eigenvalues (and eigenvectors).</p>

<p>Explain why this example does not contradict the statement that every linear transformation from a finite dimensional vector space <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> has eigenvalues.</p>
<div class="solution solution-like">
<h4 class="heading">
<span class="type">Solution</span><span class="period">.</span>
</h4>
<p>The reason this example does not contradict the statement is that <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> is an infinite dimensional vector space. In fact, the linearly independent monomials <span class="process-math">\(t^m\)</span> are all in <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> for any positive integer <span class="process-math">\(m\text{.}\)</span></p>
