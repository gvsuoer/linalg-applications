<p>There are many instances where we have a number of systems to solve of the form <span class="process-math">\(A \vx = \vb\text{,}\)</span> all with the same coefficient matrix. The system may evolve over time so that we do not know the constant vectors <span class="process-math">\(\vb\)</span> in the system all at once, but only determine them as time progresses. Each time we obtain a new vector <span class="process-math">\(\vb\text{,}\)</span> we have to apply the same row operations to reduce the coefficient matrix to solve the new system. This is time repetitive and time consuming. Instead, we can keep track of the row operations in one row reduction and save ourselves a significant amount of time. One way of doing this is the <span class="process-math">\(LU\)</span>-factorization (or decomposition).</p>
