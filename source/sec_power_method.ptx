  <title>The Power Method</title>
  <p>
    While the examples we present in this text are small in order to highlight the concepts,
    matrices that appear in real life applications are often enormous.
    For example,
    in Google's PageRank algorithm that is used to determine relative rankings of the importance of web pages,
    matrices of staggering size are used
    (most entries in the matrices are zero,
    but the size of the matrices is still huge).
    Finding eigenvalues of such large matrices through the characteristic polynomial is impractical.
    In fact, finding the roots of all but the smallest degree characteristic polynomials is a very difficult problem.
    As a result,
    using the characteristic polynomial to find eigenvalues and then finding eigenvectors is not very practical in general,
    and it is often a better option to use a numeric approximation method.
    We will consider one such method in this section,
    the <em>power method</em>.

    In Preview <xref ref="pa_4_d">Activity</xref>,
    we saw an example of a matrix
    <m>A = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 2\amp 6 \\ 5\amp 3 \end{array} \right]</m> so that the sequence <m>\{\vx_k\}</m>,
    where <m>\vx_k = A \vx_{k-1}</m>,
    converged to a dominant eigenvector of <m>A</m> for an initial guess vector <m>\vx_0 = [1 \ 0]^{\tr}</m>.
    The vectors <m>\vx_i</m> for <m>i</m> from <m>1</m> to <m>6</m>
    (with scaling)
    are approximately

      <cell><m>\vx_1 = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 0.4 \\ 1
        \end{array}  \right]</m></cell>
      <cell><m>\vx_2 = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 0.7353
        \end{array}  \right]</m></cell>

      <cell><m>\vx_4 = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 0.9575

      <cell><m>\vx_5 = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 0.9838 \\ 1

        \end{array}  \right]</m>.</cell>
    </row>
  </tabular>
  <p>
    Numerically we can see that the sequence
    <m>\{\vx_k\}</m> approaches the vector <m>[1 \ 1]^{\tr}</m>,
    and <xref ref="F_4_e_1">Figure</xref>
    illustrates this geometrically as well.

    This method of successive approximations
    <m>\vx_k = A \vx_{k-1}</m> is called the <em>power method</em>
        <idx><h>power method</h></idx>
    (since we could write <m>\vx_k</m> as <m>A^k \vx_0</m>).
    Our task now is to show that this method works in general.
    In the next activity we restrict our argument to the <m>2 \times 2</m> case,
    and then discuss the general case afterwards.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let <m>A</m> be an arbitrary
    <m>2 \times 2</m> matrix with two linearly independent eigenvectors <m>\vv_1</m> and <m>\vv_2</m> and corresponding eigenvalues
    <m>\lambda_1</m> and <m>\lambda_2</m>, respectively.
    We will also assume <m>|\lambda_1| > |\lambda_2|</m>.
    An eigenvalue whose absolute value is larger than that of any other eigenvalue is called a
    <em>dominant eigenvalue</em>.
        <idx><h>dominant eigenvalue</h></idx>
    Any eigenvector for a dominant eigenvalue is called a
    <em>dominant eigenvector</em>.
        <idx><h>dominant eigenvector</h></idx>
    Before we show that our method can be used to approximate a dominant eigenvector,
    we recall that since <m>\vv_1</m> and <m>\vv_2</m> are eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues,
    then <m>\vv_1</m> and <m>\vv_2</m> are linearly independent.
    So there exist scalars <m>a_1</m> and <m>a_2</m> such that
    <me>
      \vx_0 = a_1 \vv_1 + a_2 \vv_2
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have seen that for each positive integer <m>k</m> we can write <m>\vx_n</m> as
    <men xml:id="eq_4_e_1">
      \vx_k = a_1 \lambda_1^k \vv_1 + a_2 \lambda_2^k \vv_2
    </men>.
  </p>
  <p>
    With this representation of <m>\vx_0</m> we can now see why the power method approximates a dominant eigenvector of <m>A</m>.

      Assume as above that <m>A</m> is an arbitrary

      <m>\lambda_1</m> and <m>\lambda_2</m>, respectively.

    The power method is straightforward to implement,
    but it is not without its drawbacks.
    We began by assuming that we had a basis of eigenvectors of a matrix <m>A</m>.
    So we are also assuming that <m>A</m> is diagonalizable.
    We also assumed that <m>A</m> had a dominant eigenvalue <m>\lambda_1</m>.
    That is, if <m>A</m> is <m>n \times n</m> we assume that <m>A</m> has eigenvalues <m>\lambda_1</m>,
    <m>\lambda_2</m>,
    <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\lambda_n</m>,
    not necessarily distinct, with
    <me>
      |\lambda_1| > |\lambda_2| \geq |\lambda_3| \geq \cdots \geq |\lambda_n|
    </me>
    and with <m>\vv_i</m> an eigenvector of <m>A</m> with eigenvalue <m>\lambda_i</m>.
    We could then write any initial guess <m>\vx_0</m> in the form
    <me>
      \vx_0 = a_1 \vv_1 +  a_2\vv_2 + \cdots + a_n \vv_n
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The initial guess is also called a <em>seed</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then
    <me>
      \vx_k = a_1 \lambda_1^k \vv_1 + a_2 \lambda_2^k \vv_2 + \cdots + a_n \lambda_n^k \vv_n
    </me>
    and
    <men xml:id="eq_4_e_3">
      \frac{1}{\lambda_1^k} \vx_k = a_1 \vv_1 + a_2 \left(\frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1}\right)^k \vv_2 + \cdots + a_n \left(\frac{\lambda_n}{\lambda_1}\right)^k \vv_n
    </men>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Notice that we are not actually calculating the vectors <m>\vx_k</m> here <mdash/> this is a theoretical argument and we don't know
    <m>\lambda_1</m> and are not performing any scaling like we did in Preview <xref ref="pa_4_d">Activity</xref>.
    We are assuming that <m>\lambda_1</m> is the dominant eigenvalue of <m>A</m>, though,
    so for each <m>i</m> the terms
    <m>\left(\frac{\lambda_i}{\lambda_1}\right)^k</m> converge to <m>0</m> as <m>k</m> goes to infinity.
    Thus,
    <me>
      \vx_k \approx \lambda_1^k a_1 \vv_1
    </me>
    for large values of <m>k</m>,
    which makes the sequence <m>\{\vx_k\}</m> converge to a vector in the direction of a dominant eigenvector <m>\vv_1</m> provided <m>a_1 \neq 0</m>.
    So we need to be careful enough to choose a seed that has a nonzero component in the direction of <m>\vv_1</m>.
    Of course, we generally don't know that our matrix is diagonalizable before we make these calculations,
    but for many matrices the sequence
    <m>\{\vx_k\}</m> will approach a dominant eigenvector.
  </p>
  <p>
    The power method approximates a dominant eigenvector,
    and there are ways that we can approximate the dominant eigenvalue.
    <xref ref="ex_4_d_dominant_eigenvalue">Exercise</xref>
    presents one way <mdash/> by keeping track of the components of the <m>\vx_k</m> that have the largest absolute values,
    and the next activity shows another.

      Let <m>A</m> be an <m>n \times n</m> matrix with eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m> and corresponding eigenvector <m>\vv</m>.

          <p>

  <p>
    The result of <xref ref="act_4_d_Rayleigh">Activity</xref> is that,
    when the vectors in the sequence
    <m>\{\vx_k\}</m> approximate a dominant eigenvector of a matrix <m>A</m>,
    the quotients
    <men xml:id="eq_Rayleigh">
      \frac{(A\vx_k) \cdot \vx_k}{\vx_k \cdot \vx_k} = \frac{\vx_k^{\tr}A\vx_k}{\vx_k^{\tr}\vx_k}
    </men>
    approximate the dominant eigenvalue of <m>A</m>.
    The quotients in <xref ref="eq_Rayleigh"/> are called
    <em>Rayleigh quotients</em>.
        <idx><h>Rayleigh quotients</h></idx>
  </p>
  <p>
    To summarize,
    the procedure for applying the power method for approximating a dominant eigenvector and dominant eigenvalue of a matrix <m>A</m> is as follows.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <title>Step 1:</title>
        <p>
          Select an arbitrary nonzero vector <m>\vx_0</m> as an initial guess to a dominant eigenvector.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>Step 2:</title>
        <p>
          Let <m>\vx_1 = A\vx_0</m>.
          Let <m>k = 1</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>Step 3:</title>
        <p>
          To avoid having the magnitudes of successive approximations become excessively large,
          scale this approximation <m>\vx_k</m>.
          That is, find the entry <m>\alpha_k</m> of <m>\vx_k</m> that is largest in absolute value.
          Then replace <m>\vx_k</m> by <m>\frac{1}{\alpha_k} \vx_k</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>Step 4:</title>
        <p>
          Calculate the Rayleigh quotient <m>r_k = \frac{(A\vx_{k}) \cdot \vx_k}{\vx_k \cdot \vx_k}</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>Step 5:</title>
        <p>
          Let let <m>\vx_{k+1} = A \vx_k</m>.
          Increase <m>k</m> by <m>1</m> and repeat Steps 3 through 5.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    If the sequence <m>\{\vx_k\}</m> converges to a dominant eigenvector of <m>A</m>,
    then the sequence <m>\{r_k\}</m> converges to the dominant eigenvalue of <m>A</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The power method can be useful for approximating a dominant eigenvector as long as the successive multiplications by <m>A</m> are fairly simple <mdash/> for example,
    if many entries of <m>A</m> are zero.<fn>
    A matrix in which most entries are zero is called a <em>sparse</em> matrix.
        <idx><h>matrix</h><h>sparse</h></idx>
    </fn> The rate of convergence of the sequence
    <m>\{\vx_k\}</m> depends on the ratio <m>\frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1}</m>.
    If this ratio is close to <m>1</m>,
    then it can take many iterations before the power
    <m>\left(\frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1}\right)^k</m> makes the <m>\vv_2</m> term negligible.
    There are other methods for approximating eigenvalues and eigenvectors,
    e.g., the QR factorization, that we will not discuss at this point.
