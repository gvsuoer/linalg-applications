  <title>Application: Connecting GDP and Consumption in Romania</title>
  <p>
    It is common practice in the sciences to run experiments and collect data.
    Once data is collected it is necessary to find some way to analyze the data and predict future behavior from the data.
    One method is to find a curve that best
    <q>fits</q>
    the data, and one widely used method for curve fitting is called the
    <em>least squares</em> method.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example,
    economists are often interested in <em>consumption</em>,
    which is the purchase of goods and services for use by households.
    In ``A Statistical Analysis of GDP and Final Consumption Using Simple Linear Regression,
    the Case of Romania 1990-2010",<fn>
    B&#259;l&#259;cescu, Aniela &amp; Zaharia, Marian. (2012).
    A STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF GDP AND FINAL CONSUMPTION USING SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION. THE CASE OF ROMANIA 1990?2010.
    Annals - Economy Series. 4. 26-31.
    Available from: \url{https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227382939_A_STATISTICAL_ANALYSIS_OF_GDP_AND_FINAL_CONSUMPTION_USING_SIMPLE_LINEAR_REGRESSION_THE_CASE_OF_ROMANIA_1990-2010}.
    </fn> the authors collect data and then use simple linear regression to compare GDP
    (gross domestic product)
    to consumption in Romania.
    The data they used is seen in <xref ref="T_GDP_consumption">Table</xref>,
    with a corresponding scatterplot of the data
    (with consumption as independent variable and GDP as dependent variable).
    The units for GDP and consumption are milliions of leu
    (the currency of Romania is the leu <mdash/> on December 21, 2018,
    one leu was worth approximately $0.25 U.S.)
    The authors conclude their paper with the following statement:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <q>However, we can appreciate that linear regression model describes the correlation between the value of gross domestic product and the value of final consumption and may be transcribed following form:
    PIB = -3127.51+ 1.22 CF. Analysis of correlation between GDP and final consumption (private consumption and public consumption) will result in an increase of 1.22 units of monetary value of gross domestic product.
    We can conclude that the Gross Domestic Product of our country is strongly influenced by the private and public consumption.</q>

  <p>
    As we can see from the scatterplot,
    the relationship between the GDP and consumption is not exactly linear,
    but looks to be very close.
    To make correlations between GDP and consumption as the authors did,
    we need to understand how they determined their approximate linear relationship between the variables.
    With a good approximation function we can then compare the variables,
    extrapolate from the data,
    and make predictions or interpolate and estimate between data points.
    For example,
    we could use our approximation function to predict,
    as the authors did, how changes in consumption affect GDP
    (or vice versa).
    Later in this section we will see how to find the least squares line to fit this data <mdash/> the best linear approximation to the data.
    This involves finding a vector in a certain subspace of <m>\R^2</m> that is closest to a given vector.
    Linear least squares approximation is a special case of a more general process that we will encounter in later sections where we learn how to project sets onto subspaces.
