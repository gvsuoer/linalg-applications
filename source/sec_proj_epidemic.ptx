  <title>Project: Modeling an Epidemic</title>
  <p>
    The COVID-19 epidemic has generated many mathematical and statistical models to try to understand the spread of the virus.
    In this project we examine a simple stochastic model of the spread of an epidemic proposed by Norman Bailey in 1950.<fn>
    Bailey, N. T. J. (1950) A simple stochastic epidemic.
    <pubtitle>Biometrika</pubtitle> 37
    </fn> This is a model of a relatively mild epidemic in which no one dies from the disease.
    Of course, mathematicians build on simple models to form more complicated and realistic ones,
    but this is a good, and accessible, starting point.
    Bailey writes about the the difficulties in the stochastic<fn>
    The word <term>stochastic</term> refers to quantities that have a random pattern that can be analyzed statistically,
    but generally cannot be predicted precisely.
    </fn> analysis of epidemics.
    For example, the overall epidemic
    <q>can often be broken down into smaller epidemics occurring in separate regional subdivisions</q>
    and that these regional epidemics
    <q>are not necessarily in phase and often interact with each other</q>. This is behavior that has been clearly evident in the COVID-19 epidemic in the US. Even within a single district,
    <q>it is obvious that a given infectious individual has not the same chance of infecting each inhabitant.
    He will probably be in close contact with a small number of people only,
    perhaps of the order of 10-50,
    depending on the nature of his activities.</q>
    But then the epidemic for the whole district will
    <q>be built up from epidemics taking place in several relatively small groups of associates and acquaintances.</q>
    So we can see in this analysis that an epidemic can spread from small,
    localized areas.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bailey begins by considering a community of <m>n</m> persons who are susceptible to a disease,
    and supposes introducing a single infected individual into the community.
    Bailey makes the following assumptions:
    <q>We shall assume that the infection spreads by contact between the members of the community,
    and that it is not sufficiently serious for cases to be withdrawn from circulation by isolation or death;
    also that no case becomes clear of infection during the course of the main part of the epidemic.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    To see how the Bailey's model is constructed, we make some assumption.
    We split the population at any time into two groups,
    those infected with the disease,
    and those susceptible, i.e., not currently infected.
    We assume that once an individual is infected,
    that individual is always infected.
    A person catches the disease by interacting with an infected individual.
    That is, if a susceptible individual meets an infected individual,
    the chance that the susceptible person contracts the disease is <m>\beta</m>
    (the <em>infection rate</em>).
    For example,
    there many be a <m>5\%</m> chance that an encounter between a susceptible individual and an infected individual results in the susceptible individual contracting the disease.
    (Of course, there are many variables involved in such an interaction <mdash/> if no one is wearing masks and the interaction involves close contact,
    the infection rate would be higher than if everyone practices social distancing.
    For the sake of simplicity,
    we assume one infection rate for the entire population.)
    With this simple model we assume assume homogeneous mixing in the population.
    That is, it is equally likely that any one individual will interact with any other in a given time frame.
    Let <m>y</m> be the number of susceptible individuals in the population at time <m>t</m>.
    Then the number of infected individuals is the total population minus <m>y</m>,
    or <m>n+1-y</m>
    (recall that we introduced an infected individual into the population).
    So the change in the number of susceptible individuals in the population at time <m>s</m> is <m>-\beta y(n+1-y)</m>
    (since the <m>n+1-y</m> susceptible individuals interact with the <m>y</m> infected individuals).
    That is, <m>\frac{dy}{ds} = -\beta y (n+1-y)</m>.
    Bailey makes the substitution of <m>t</m> for <m>\beta s</m> to simplify the equation.
    This substitution makes <m>ds = \frac{1}{\beta} dt</m>,
    which produces the differential equation <m>\beta \frac{dy}{dt} =  -\beta y (n+1-y)</m>.
    The <m>\beta</m>s cancel, producing the differential equation
    <men xml:id="eq_Bailey_1">
      \frac{dy}{dt} = -y(n+1-y)
    </men>
    with <m>y(0) = n</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The above analysis is just to provide some background.
    Bailey's stochastic model deals with probabilities instead of actual numbers,
    so we now take that approach.
    For <m>r</m> from <m>0</m> to <m>n</m>,
    let <m>p_r(t)</m> be the probability that there are <m>r</m> susceptible individuals still uninfected at time <m>t</m>.
    Similar to the case describe above,
    if there are <m>r</m> susceptible individuals,
    any one of them can be come infected by interacting with the <m>n-r+1</m> infected individuals.
    With that in mind, Bailey's model of the spread of the disease is the system
    <me>
      \begin{cases}\frac{d p_r(t)}{dt} = (r+1)(n-r)p_{r+1}(t) - r(n-r+1)p_r(t) \amp \text{ for }  0 \leq r \leq n-1\\ \frac{dp_n(t)}{dt} = -np_n(t). \amp \end{cases}
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    That is,
    <md>
      <mrow>\frac{d p_0(t)}{dt} \amp = np_1(t)</mrow>
      <mrow>\frac{d p_1(t)}{dt} \amp = 2(n-1)p_2(t) - np_1(t)</mrow>
      <mrow>\frac{d p_2(t)}{dt} \amp = 3(n-2)p_3(t) - 2(n-1)p_2(t)</mrow>
      <mrow>\vdots \amp</mrow>
      <mrow>\frac{d p_{n-1}(t)}{dt} \amp = np_n(t) - (n-1)(2)p_{n-1}(t)</mrow>
      <mrow>\frac{dp_n(t)}{dt} \amp = -np_n(t)</mrow>
    </md>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since we start with <m>n</m> susceptible individuals,
    at time <m>0</m> we have <m>p_r(0) = 0</m> if <m>0 \leq r \leq n-1</m> and <m>p_n(0)=1</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This system can be written in matrix form.
    Let <m>P(t) = \left[ \begin{array}{c} p_0(t)\\p_1(t) \\ \vdots \\ p_n(t) \end{array}  \right]</m>.
    Assuming that we can differentiate a vector function component-wise,
    our system becomes
    <me>
      \frac{dP(t)}{dt} = A P(t)
    </me>
    with initial condition <m>P(0) = [0 \ 0 \ \ldots \ 0 \ 1]^{\tr}</m>, where
    <me>
      A=\left[ \begin{array}{ccccccccc} 0\amp n\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp  \cdots \amp 0\amp 0\amp 0 \\ 0\amp -n\amp 2(n-1)\amp 0 \amp 0\amp \cdots \amp 0\amp 0\amp 0 \\ 0\amp 0\amp -2(n-1)\amp 3(n-2) \amp 0 \amp  \cdots \amp  0\amp 0\amp 0 \\ \amp \amp \amp \amp \vdots\amp \amp \amp \amp  \\ 0\amp 0\amp  \cdots \amp -r(n-r+1) \amp (r+1)(n-r)\amp  0 \amp  \cdots \amp  0\amp 0 \\ \amp \amp \amp \amp \vdots\amp \amp \amp \amp   \\ 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp \cdots\amp 0\amp 0 \amp 0\amp -2(n-1)\amp n \\ 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp \cdots\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp -n \end{array}  \right]
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The solution to this system involves a matrix exponential <m>e^{At}</m>.
    The matrix exponential acts much like our familiar exponential function in that
    <me>
      \frac{d}{dx}e^{At} = Ae^{At}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    With this in mind it is not difficult to see that Bailey's system has solution <m>P(t)= e^{At}P(0)</m>.
    To truly understand this solution,
    we need to make sense of the matrix exponential <m>e^{At}</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can make sense of the matrix exponential by utilizing the Taylor series of the exponential function centered at the origin.
    From calculus we know that
    <men xml:id="eq_exponential">
      e^x = 1 + x + \frac{1}{2!}x^2 + \frac{1}{3!}x^3 + \cdots + \frac{1}{n!}x^n + \cdots = \sum_{k\geq 0} \frac{1}{k!}x^k
    </men>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since powers of square matrices are defined,
    the matrix exponential <m>e^M</m> of a square matrix <m>M</m> is then
    <men xml:id="eq_Matrix_exponential">
      e^M = I_n + M + \frac{1}{2!}M^2 + \frac{1}{3!}M^3 + \cdots + \frac{1}{n!}M^n + \cdots = \sum_{k\geq 0} \frac{1}{k!}M^k
    </men>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Just as in calculus,
    <m>e^M</m> converges for any square matrix <m>M</m>.
  </p>

  <project>
    <introduction>
    <p>
      If <m>M</m> is diagonalizable,
      then <m>e^M</m> can be found fairly easily.
      Assume that there is an invertible matrix <m>P</m> such that <m>P^{-1}MP = D</m>,
      where <m>D = \left[ \begin{array}{ccccc} \lambda_1\amp  0 \amp 0\amp  \cdots \amp 0 \\ 0 \amp  \lambda_2\amp  0 \amp \cdots \amp  0 \\ \vdots \amp \vdots \amp \vdots \amp  \ddots \amp  \vdots \\ 0 \amp  0\amp  0 \amp \cdots \amp  \lambda_n \end{array}  \right]</m> is a diagonal matrix.

            Use <xref ref="eq_Matrix_exponential"/> to explain why

              e^M = P\left[ \begin{array}{ccccc} e^{\lambda_1}\amp  0 \amp 0\amp  \cdots \amp 0 \\ 0 \amp  e^{\lambda_2}\amp  0 \amp \cdots \amp  0 \\ \vdots \amp \vdots \amp \vdots \amp  \ddots \amp  \vdots \\ 0 \amp  0\amp  0 \amp \cdots \amp  e^{\lambda_n} \end{array}  \right]P^{-1}

  <p>
    As we will see,
    the matrix <m>A</m> in Bailey's model is not diagonalizable,
    so we need to learn how to consider the matrix exponential in this new situation.
    In these cases we can utilize the Jordan canonical form.
    Of course, the computations are more complicated.
    We first illustrate with the <m>2 \times 2</m> case.
  </p>

  <project>
    <introduction>
    <p>
      Assume <m>A</m> is a <m>2 \times 2</m> matrix with Jordan canonical form<m>J = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} \lambda\amp 1\\0\amp \lambda \end{array}  \right]</m>,
      where <m>C^{-1}AC = J</m>.
      The same argument as above shows that
      <me>
        e^A = Ce^JC^{-1}
      </me>
      and so we only have to be able to find <m>e^J</m>.
    </p>
    </introduction>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            We can write <m>J</m> in the form <m>J = D+N</m>,
            where <m>D</m> is a diagonal matrix and <m>N</m> is a nilpotent matrix.
            Find <m>D</m> and <m>N</m> in this case and explain why <m>N</m> is a nilpotent matrix.

      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Find the index of <m>N</m>.
            That is, find the smallest positive power <m>s</m> of <m>N</m> such that <m>N^s = 0</m>.
            Then use <xref ref="eq_Matrix_exponential"/> to find <m>e^N</m>.

      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Assume that the matrix exponential satisfies the standard property of exponential functions that <m>e^{R+S} = e^Re^S</m> for any
            <m>n \times n</m> matrices <m>R</m> and <m>S</m>.
            Use this property to explain why
            <me>
              e^J = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} e^{\lambda}\amp e^{\lambda}\\0\amp e^{\lambda} \end{array}  \right]

      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Use the previous information to calculate <m>e^M</m> where <m>M = \left[ \begin{array}{cr} 3 \amp -1 \\ 4 \amp 7 \end{array} \right]</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </task>
  
  </project>

  <p>
    Now we turn to the general case of finding the matrix exponential <m>e^M</m> when <m>M</m> is not diagonalizable.
    Suppose <m>C</m> is an invertible matrix and <m>C^{-1}MC = J</m>,
    where <m>J</m> is a Jordan canonical form of <m>M</m>.
    Then we have
    <me>
      e^M = e^{CJC^{-1}} = C e^J C^{-1}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We know that <m>J</m> can be written in the form <m>D+N</m>,
    where <m>D</m> is a diagonal matrix and <m>N</m> is an upper triangular matrix with zeros on the diagonal and some ones along the superdiagonal.
    It follows that
    <me>
      e^M = Ce^De^NC^{-1}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We know that if
    <me>
      D = \left[ \begin{array}{cccccc} \lambda_1\amp 0\amp 0\amp \cdots\amp 0\amp 0 \\  0\amp \lambda_2\amp 0\amp \cdots\amp 0\amp 0 \\ \amp \amp \amp \ddots\amp \amp  \\ 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp \cdots\amp 0\amp \lambda_n \end{array}  \right]
    </me>,
    then
    <me>
      e^D = \left[ \begin{array}{cccccc} e^{\lambda_1}\amp 0\amp 0\amp \cdots\amp 0\amp 0 \\  0\amp e^{\lambda_2}\amp 0\amp \cdots\amp 0\amp 0 \\ \amp \amp \amp \ddots\amp \amp  \\ 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp \cdots\amp 0\amp e^{\lambda_n} \end{array}  \right]
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    So finding <m>e^M</m> boils down to determining <m>e^N</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now <m>N</m> has only zero as an eigenvalue, so <m>N</m> is nilpotent.
    If <m>k</m> is the index of <m>N</m>, then
    <me>
      e^N = I + N + \frac{1}{2}N^2 + \frac{1}{3!}N^3 + \cdots + \frac{1}{(k-1)!}N^{k-1}
    </me>.

    One use for mathematical models like Bailey's is to make predictions that can help set policies.
    Recall that we made the substitution of <m>t</m> for <m>\beta s</m> in our original equation in order to make the equations dimensionless,
    where <m>\beta</m> is the infection rate <mdash/> the rate at which people catch the disease.
    Let us replace <m>t</m> with <m>\beta s</m> in our solution and analyze the effect of changing the value of <m>\beta</m>.
  </p>

  <project>
    <statement>
    <p>
      If <m>\beta = 1</m>,
      then the disease is easily transmitted from person to person.
      If <m>\beta</m> can be made smaller,
      then the disease is not so easily transmitted.
      We continue to work with the case where <m>n=5</m>.
      Plot the curves <m>p_0(t)</m> through <m>p_5(t)</m> on the same set of axes for the following values of <m>\beta</m>:
      <me>
        (a) \beta =1  (b) \beta = 0.5  (c) \beta = 0.25
      </me>.

    <p>
      Explain what you see and how this might be related to the phrase
      <q>flattening the curve</q>
      used during the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020.

  <p>
    In general, the matrix <m>A</m> has eigenvalues of algebraic multiplicity 1 and 2.
    When <m>n</m> is even,
    <m>n+1</m> is odd and the eigenvalues of <m>A</m> will occur in pairs except for the single eigenvalue <m>0</m> of multiplicity 1.
    When <m>n</m> is odd,
    <m>n+1</m> is even and we have two eigenvalues of multiplicity 1:
    <m>0</m> and the eigenvalue
    <m>-r(n-r+1)</m> when <m>r = \frac{n+1}{2}</m>,
    at which <m>-r(n-r+1) = -\frac{(n+1)^2}{4}</m>.
    It can be shown, although we won't do it here,
    that every eigenvalue of algebraic multiplicity 2 has geometric multiplicity 1.
    This information completely determines the Jordan canonical formof <m>A</m>.
