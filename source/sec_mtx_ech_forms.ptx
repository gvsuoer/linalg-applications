  <title>The Echelon Forms of a Matrix</title>
  <p>
    In the previous sections we saw how to simplify a linear system and its matrix representation via 
    the elimination method without changing the solution set.
    This process is more efficient when performed on the matrix representation rather than on the 
    system itself.
    Furthermore,
    the process of applying row operations to any augmented matrix is one that can be automated.
    In order to write an algorithm that can be used with any size augmented matrix to the extent 
    that it can be applied even by a computer program,
    it is necessary to have a consistent procedure and a stopping point for the simplification process.
    The two main properties that we want the simplified augmented matrix to satisfy are that it should 
    be easy to see if the system has solutions from the simplified matrix,
    and in cases when there are solutions,
    the general form of the solutions can be easily found.
    Hence the topic of this section is to define the process of elimination completely and generally.
  </p>
  <p>
    We begin by discussing the <term>row echelon</term> or, simply,
    <term>echelon</term> form of a matrix.
    We know that the forward phase of the elimination on a linear system produces a system which can be solved by back substitution.
    The matrix representation of such a simplified system is said to be in <term>row echelon</term>
    or simply <term>echelon</term> form.
    Note that matrices in this form have the first nonzero entry in each row to the right of and 
    below the first nonzero entry in the preceding row.
    Our next step is to formally describe this form <mdash/> one that you tried to explain in 
    problem 3 of <xref ref="pa_1_c"></xref>.

    <statement>
      <p>
        A rectangular matrix is in <term>row echelon form</term>
        (or simply <term>echelon form</term>) if it has the following properties:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              All nonzero rows are above any rows of all zeros.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Each <term>pivot</term>
              (the first non-zero entry reading from left to right) in a row is in a column to the 
              right of the pivot of the row above it.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
  <idx><h>leading entry of a row</h></idx>
  <idx><h>pivot positions</h></idx>
  <idx><h>pivot column</h></idx>
    A pivot is also called a <term>leading entry</term>
    of a row.
    Note that properties (1) and (2) above imply that all entries in a column below a pivot are zeros.
    It can be shown that the positions of these pivots,
    called <term>pivot positions</term>,
    are unique and tell us quite a bit about a matrix and the solutions of the linear system it 
    corresponds to.
    The columns that the pivots are in,
    called <term>pivot columns</term>,
    will also have useful properties as we will see soon.

  <remark>
  <p>
    Compare the row echelon form of an augmented matrix to the corresponding system.
    Do you clearly see the correspondence between the requirements of the row echelon form and the
     properly eliminated variables in the system?
    Can you quickly come up with a system which will be in row echelon form when represented in 
    augmented matrix form?
    Can you modify the standard row echelon form definition to cover cases where the elimination 
    process eliminates the variables from last to first?
    For example,
    in a system with three equations in three unknowns,
    the last variable, say <m>x_3</m>,
    can be eliminated from the second equation,
    and the last two variables,
    say <m>x_2, x_3</m> can be eliminated from the last equation.
    How would you define this modified row echelon form for a general system with this modified 
    elimination process?
  </p>
  </remark>

  <p>
    Once an augmented matrix is in row echelon form,
    we can use back substitution to solve the corresponding system.
    However, we can make solving much easier with just a little more elimination work.
  </p>
  <p>
    Row operations are easy to apply, so if we are inclined,
    there is no reason to stop at the row echelon form.
    For example, starting with the following matrix
    <me>
      \left[ \begin{array}{crcr|r} 2\amp -1\amp 2\amp 2\amp 7 \\ 0\amp 1\amp 3\amp -1\amp -1 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 2\amp 4 \end{array}  \right]
    </me>
    in row echelon form,
    we could take the row operations even farther and avoid the process of back substitution altogether.
    First, we multiply the last row by <m>1/2</m> to simplify that row:
    <me>
      \begin{array}{c} \text{ } \\ \text{ } \\  \frac{1}{2} R_3 \to R_3 \end{array}  \left[ \begin{array}{crcr|r} 2\amp -1\amp 2\amp 2\amp 7 \\ 0\amp 1\amp 3\amp -1\amp -1 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 1\amp 2 \end{array}  \right]
    </me>.

    Then we use the third row to eliminate entries above the third pivot:
    <me>
      \begin{array}{c}  R_1-2R_3 \to R_1  \\  R_2+R_3 \to R_2   \\ \text{ } \end{array}   \left[ \begin{array}{crcr|r} 2\amp -1\amp 2\amp 0\amp 3 \\ 0\amp 1\amp 3\amp 0\amp 1 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 1\amp 2 \end{array}  \right]
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can continue in this manner
    (we call this process <term>backward elimination</term>)
    to make 0 all of the entries above the pivots
    (one in the second column, and one in the fourth)
    with the pivots being 1, to ultimately obtain the equivalent augmented matrix
    <me>
      \left[ \begin{array}{crcr|r} 1\amp 0\amp \frac{5}{2} \amp 0\amp 2 \\ 0\amp 1\amp 3\amp 0\amp 1 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 1\amp 2 \end{array}  \right]
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The system corresponding to this augmented matrix is
    <md alignment="alignat">
      <mrow> {}x_1   \amp {}     \amp {}    \amp {}+{}  \amp {\frac{5}{2}}x_3    \amp {}    \amp {}     \amp {}={}  \amp  \ 2</mrow>
      <mrow>{}      \amp {}     \amp {}x_2   \amp {}+{}  \amp {3}x_3    \amp { }              \amp {}     \amp {}={}   \amp  \ 1</mrow>
      <mrow>{}      \amp {}    \amp {}    \amp {}     \amp {}      \amp { }              \amp {}x_4  \amp {}={}   \amp  \ 2</mrow>
    </md>
    so we can just directly read off the solution to the system:
    <m>x_3</m> free and <m>x_1=2- \frac{5}{2}x_3</m>, <m>x_2=1-3x_3</m>, <m>x_4=2</m>.
    This final row reduced form makes solving the system very easy,
    and this form is called the <term>reduced row echelon</term> form.
  </p>

  <definition>
  <idx><h>row echelon form</h><h>reduced</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A rectangular matrix is in <term>reduced row echelon form</term>
        (or <term>reduced echelon form</term>)
        if the matrix is in row echelon form and
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              The pivot in each nonzero row is 1.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Each pivot is the only nonzero entry in its column.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    In short, the reduced row echelon form of a matrix is a row echelon form in which all the 
    pivots are 1 and any entries
    <em>below and above</em> the pivots are 0.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we use either of these two row echelon forms,
    solving the original system becomes straightforward and,
    as a result,
    these matrix forms are stopping points for the row operation algorithm to solve a system.
    It is also very easy to write a computer program to perform row operations to obtain and row 
    echelon or reduced row echelon form of the matrix,
    making hand computations unnecessary.
    We will discuss this shortly.
  </p>

  <remark>
  <p>
    Compare the reduced row echelon form of an augmented matrix to the corresponding system.
    Do you clearly see the correspondence between the requirements of the reduced row echelon form 
    and the way the variables appear in the equations in the system?
    Can you quickly come up with a system which will be in reduced row echelon form when represented 
    in augmented matrix form?

    <title>Note</title>
    <p>
      We have used the elimination method on augmented matrices so far.
      However, the elimination method can be applied on just the coefficient matrix,
      or other matrices that will arise in other contexts,
      and will provide useful information in each of those cases.
      Therefore, the row echelon form and reduced row echelon form is defined for
      <em>any matrix</em>, and from now on,
      a matrix will be a general matrix unless explicitly specified to be an augmented matrix.
