  <title>Project: Planetary Orbits and Change of Basis</title>
  <p>
    We are interested in determining the orbit of planet that orbits the sun.
    Finding the equation of such an orbit is not difficult,
    but just having an equation is not enough.
    For many purposes,
    it is important to know where the planet is fro the perspective or earth observation.
    This is a more complicated question,
    one we can address through change of bases matrices.<fn>
    This project is based on the paper
    <q>Planetary Orbits: Change of Basis in R<m>^3</m></q>, Donald Teets,
    <pubtitle>Teaching Mathematics and its Applications: An International Journal of the IMA</pubtitle>, Volume 17, Issue 2, 1 June 1998, Pages 66-68.

      Since planetary orbits are elliptical, not circular,
      we need to understand ellipses.
      An ellipse is a shape like a flattened circle.
      More specifically,
      while a circle is the set of points equidistant from a fixed point,
      and ellipse is a set of points so that the sum of the distances from a point on the ellipse to two fixed points
      (called foci)
      is a constant.
      We can use this definition to derive an equation for an ellipse.
      We will simplify by rotating and translating an ellipse so that its foci are at points <m>(-c,0)</m> and <m>(c,0)</m>,
      and the constant sum is <m>2a</m>.
      Let <m>(x,y)</m> be a point on the ellipse as illustrated in <xref ref="F_ellipse_cob"></xref>.
      Use the fact that the sum of the distances from <m>(x,y)</m> to the foci is <m>2a</m> to show that <m>(x,y)</m> satisfies the equation
      <men xml:id="eq_orbit_ellipse">
        \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1
      </men>,
      where the points <m>(0,b)</m> and <m>(0,-b)</m> are the <m>y</m> intercepts of the ellipse.
    </p>

  </project>
  <p>
    The longer axis of an ellipse is called the major axis and the axis perpendicular to the major axis through the origin is the minor axis.
    Half of these axes
    (from the origin)
    are the semi-major axis and the semi-minor axis.
    So the parameter <m>a</m> in <xref ref="eq_orbit_ellipse"/> is the length of the semi-major axis and the parameter <m>b</m> is the length of the semi-minor axis.
    Note that the points <m>(0,b)</m> and <m>(0,-b)</m> are the <m>y</m> intercepts and the points <m>(a,0)</m> and <m>(-a,0)</m> are the <m>x</m> intercepts of this ellipse.
    Note that if <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are equal,
    then the ellipse is a circle.
    How far the ellipse deviates from a circle is called the <term>eccentricity</term>
    (usually denoted as <m>e</m>)
    of the ellipse.
    In other words,
    the eccentricity is a measure of how flattened en ellipse is,
    and this is determined by how close <m>c</m> is to <m>a</m>,
    or how close the ratio <m>\frac{c}{a}</m> is to <m>1</m>.
    Thus, we define the eccentricity of an ellipse by
    <me>
      e =\frac{c}{a} = \sqrt{1-\frac{b^2}{a^2}}
    </me>.

    Now we assume we have a planet
    (different from the earth)
    orbiting the sun and we establish how to convert back and forth from the coordinate system of earth's orbit to the coordinate system of the planet's orbit.
    To do so we need to establish some coordinate systems.
    We assume the orbit of earth is in the standard <m>xy</m> plane,
    with the sun
    (one of the foci)
    at the origin.
    The elliptical orbit of the planet is in some other plane with coordinate axes <m>x'</m> and <m>y'</m>.
    The two orbital planes intersect in a line.
    Let this line be the <m>x'</m> axis and let <m>\alpha</m> be the angle the positive <m>x'</m> axis makes with the positive <m>x</m> axis.
    We can represent the elliptical orbit of the planet in the <m>x'y'</m> plane,
    but the <m>x'</m> and <m>y'</m> axes are not likely to be the best axes for this orbit.
    So we define a third coordinate system <m>x''y''</m> in the <m>x'y'</m> plane so that the origin
    (the position of the sun)
    is at one focus of the planet's orbit and the <m>x''</m> axis is the major axis of the orbit and the <m>y''</m> axis is the minor axis of the orbit of the planet.
    The unit vectors <m>\vb_1</m>,
    <m>\vb_2</m>,
    and <m>\vb_3</m> in the positive <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>,
    and <m>z</m> directions define a basis <m>\CB = \{\vb_1, \vb_2, \vb_3\}</m> for <m>\R^3</m>,
    the unit vectors <m>\vb'_1</m>,
    <m>\vb'_2</m>,
    <m>\vb'_3</m> in the positive <m>x'</m>, <m>y'</m>,
    and <m>z'</m> directions define a basis <m>\CB' = \{\vb'_1, \vb'_2, \vb'_3\}</m> for <m>\R^3</m>,
    and the unit vectors <m>\vb''_1</m>,
    <m>\vb''_2</m>,
    <m>\vb''_3</m> in the positive <m>x''</m>, <m>y''</m>,
    and <m>z''</m> directions define a basis <m>\CB'' = \{\vb''_1, \vb''_2, \vb''_3\}</m> for <m>\R^3</m>.

    Finally, let <m>\gamma</m> be the angle between the positive <m>x'</m> axis and the positive <m>x''</m> axis as shown at left in <xref ref="F_orbits"></xref>.
    Our first step is to find the change of basis matrix from <m>\CB''</m> to <m>\CB'</m>.

  <p>
    With the change of basis matrices we can convert from any one coordinate system to the other.
    Note that all of the change of basis matrices are written in terms of angles,
    so it will be convenient to have a way to express points on our ellipses using angles as well.
    Given any point on an ellipse
    (or any point in the plane),
    we can represent the coordinates of that point in terms of the angle <m>\theta</m> the vector through the origin and the point makes with the positive <m>x</m>-axis and the distance <m>r</m> from the origin to the point as shown in <xref ref="F_ellipse_polar"></xref>.
    In this representation we have
    <m>x = r\cos(\theta)</m> and <m>y = r \sin(\theta)</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    So we can start in the <m>x''y''</m> coordinate system with the coordinate vector of a point <m>\left[\overrightarrow{OP}\right]_{\CB''} = [ r\cos(\theta) \ r\sin(\theta) \ 0]^{\tr}</m>.
    Then to view this point in the <m>xy</m> system,
    we apply the change of basis matrices
    <me>
      \left[\overrightarrow{OP}\right]_{\CB} = \underset{\CB \leftarrow \CB'}{P} \underset{\CB' \leftarrow \CB''}{P} [ r\cos(\theta) \ r\sin(\theta) \ 0]^{\tr}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course we can also covert from <m>\CB</m> coordinates to <m>\CB''</m> coordinates by applying the inverses of our change of basis matrices.
