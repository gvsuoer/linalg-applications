  <title>The Length of a Vector</title>
  <p>
    We can use inner products to define the length of any vector in an inner product space and the distance between two vectors in an inner product space.
    The idea comes right from the relationship between lengths of vectors in <m>\R^n</m> and inner products on <m>\R^n</m>
    (compare to <xref ref="def_6_a_length_Rn"></xref>).
  </p>

  <definition>
  <idx><h>length of a vector in an inner product space</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\vv</m> be a vector in an inner product space.
        The <term>length</term> of <m>\vv</m> is the real number
        <me>
          ||\vv|| = \sqrt{\langle \vv, \vv \rangle}
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    The length of a vector in a vector space is also called
    <term>magnitude</term> or <term>norm</term>.
    Just as with inner products on <m>\R^n</m> we can use the notion of length to define unit vectors in inner product spaces
    (compare to <xref ref="def_6_a_unit_vector"></xref>).
  </p>

  <definition>
  <idx><h>unit vector in an inner product space</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A vector <m>\vv</m> in an inner product space is a
        <term>unit vector</term> if <m>||\vv|| = 1</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    We can find a unit vector in the direction of a nonzero vector <m>\vv</m> in an inner product space by dividing by the norm of the vector.
    That is, the vector <m>\ds \frac{\vv}{||\vv||}</m> is a unit vector in the direction of the vector <m>\vv</m>,
    provided that <m>\vv</m> is not zero.
  </p>
  <p>
    We define the distance between vectors <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> in an inner product space in the same way we defined distance using the dot product
    (compare to <xref ref="def_6_a_distance"></xref>).
  </p>

  <definition>
  <idx><h>distance between vectors in an inner product space</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> be vectors in an inner product space.
        The <term>distance between</term> <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> is the length of the difference <m>\vu - \vv</m> or
        <me>
          || \vu - \vv ||
        </me>.
      </p>

    <introduction>
    <p>
      The <term>trace</term>
      (see <xref ref="def_trace"></xref>)
      of an <m>n \times n</m> matrix
      <m>A = [a_{ij}]</m> is the sum of the diagonal entries of <m>A</m>.
      That is,
      <me>
        \trace(A) = a_{11} + a_{22} + \cdots + a_{nn}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are in the space <m>\M_{n \times n}</m> of
      <m>n \times n</m> matrices with real entries,
      we define the mapping <m>\langle  \ , \ \rangle</m> from <m>\M_{n \times n} \times \M_{n \times n}</m> to <m>\R</m> by
      <me>
        \langle A, B \rangle = \trace\left(AB^{\tr}\right)
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This mapping is an inner product on the space <m>\M_{n \times n}</m> called the
      <term>Frobenius</term> inner product
      (details are in the exercises).
      Let <m>A = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 1\amp 0\\2\amp 2 \end{array} \right]</m> and
      <m>B = \left[ \begin{array}{rc} -3\amp 4\\-2\amp 1 \end{array} \right]</m> in <m>\M_{2 \times 2}</m>.
