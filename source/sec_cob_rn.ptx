  <title>Change of Basis in <m>\R^n</m></title>
  <p>
    In calculus we change coordinates,
    from rectangular to polar, for example,
    to make certain calculations easier.
    In order for us to be able to work effectively in different coordinate systems,
    and to easily change back and forth as needed,
    we will want to have a way to effectively transition from one coordinate system to another.
    In other words, if we have two different bases for <m>\R^n</m>,
    we want a straightforward way to translate between the coordinate vectors of any given vector in <m>\R^n</m> with respect to the two bases.

                  Show that <m>\CB</m> and <m>\CC</m> are bases for <m>\R^2</m>.

                  Let <m>\vv = 3 \vb_1 + 2 \vb_2</m>.

                  Since <m>\CC</m> is also a basis for <m>\R^2</m>,
                  there is also a coordinate vector for <m>\vv</m> with respect to <m>\CC</m>,
                  and it is reasonable to ask how
                  <m>[\vv]_{\CC}</m> is related to <m>[\vv]_{\CB}</m>.
                  Recall that coordinate vectors respect linear combinations <mdash/> that is
                  <me>
                    [r\vx + s\vy]_{\CS} = r[\vx]_{\CS} + s[\vy]_{\CS}
                  </me>
                  for any vectors <m>\vx</m> and <m>\vy</m> in <m>\R^n</m>  with basis <m>\CS</m>,
                  and any scalars <m>r</m> and <m>s</m>.
                  Use the fact that <m>\vv = 3 \vb_1 + 2 \vb_2</m> and the linearity of the coordinate transformation with respect to the basis <m>\CC</m> to express
                  <m>[\vv]_{\CC}</m> in terms of <m>[\vb_1]_{\CC}</m> and
                  <m>[\vb_2]_{\CC}</m> (don't actually calculate
                  <m>[\vb_1]_{\CC}</m> and <m>[\vb_2]_{\CC}</m> yet,
                  just leave your result in terms of the symbols
                  <m>[\vb_1]_{\CC}</m> and <m>[\vb_2]_{\CC}</m>.)
                </p>

              <li>
                <p>
                  The result of part (c) can be expressed as a matrix-vector product of the form
                  <me>
                    [\vv]_{\CC} = P[\vv]_{\CB}
                  </me>.
                  Describe how the columns of the matrix <m>P</m> are related to
                  <m>[\vb_1]_{\CC}</m> and <m>[\vb_2]_{\CC}</m>.

              <li>
                <p>
                  Now calculate <m>[\vb_1]_{\CC}</m>,
                  <m>[\vb_2]_{\CC}</m>, and <m>[\vv]_{\CC}</m>.
                  Determine the entries of the matrix <m>P</m> and verify in this example that <m>[\vv]_{\CC} = P[\vv]_{\CB}</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            The matrix <m>P</m> that we constructed in problem (1) allows us to quickly and easily switch from coordinates with respect to a basis <m>\CB</m> to coordinates with respect to another basis <m>\CC</m>,
            providing a way to effectively transition from one coordinate system to another as described in the introduction.
            This matrix <m>P</m> is called a
            <em>change of basis matrix</em>.
            In problem (1) we explained why the change of basis matrix exists,
            and in this problem we will see another perspective from which to view this matrix.
            Let <m>\CB = \{\vb_1, \vb_2\}</m> and
            <m>\CC = \{\vc_1, \vc_2\}</m> be two bases for <m>\R^2</m>
            (not the specific bases we used earlier in this activity,
            but any bases).
            The change of basis matrix <m>P</m> from <m>\CB</m> to <m>\CC</m> has the property that
            <m>P[\vx]_{\CB} = [\vx]_{\CC}</m> for every vector <m>\vx</m> in <m>\R^2</m>.
            We can determine the entries of <m>P</m> by applying this formula to specific vectors in <m>\R^2</m>.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  What are <m>[\vb_1]_{\CB}</m> and <m>[\vb_2]_{\CB}</m>?
                  Why?
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If <m>A</m> is an <m>n \times n</m> matrix and <m>\ve_1</m>,
                  <m>\ve_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
                  <m>\ve_n</m> are the standard unit vectors in <m>\R^n</m>
                  (that is, <m>\ve_i</m> is the <m>i</m>th column of the <m>n \times n</m> identity matrix),
                  then what does the product <m>A \ve_i</m> tell us about the matrix <m>A</m>?
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Combine the results of parts (a) and (b) and the equation
                  <m>P[\vx]_{\CB} = [\vx]_{\CC}</m> to explain why <m>P = [[\vb_1]_{\CC} \ [\vb_2]_{\CC}]</m>.
