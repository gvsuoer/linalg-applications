    Systems of linear equations arise in almost every field of study:
    mathematics, statistics, physics,
    chemistry, biology, economics, sociology,
    computer science, engineering, and many, many others.
    We will study the theory behind solving systems of linear equations,
    implications of this theory,
    and applications of linear algebra as we proceed throughout this text.

            Consider the following system of two linear equations in two unknowns,
            <m>x_1, x_2</m>:
            <md alignment="alignat">
              <mrow>2x_1  \amp {}-{}  \amp 3x_2   \amp = 0</mrow>
              <mrow>x_1   \amp {}-{}   \amp x_2    \amp = 1</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            One way to solve such a system of linear equations is the method of substitution
            (where one equation is solved for one variable and then the resulting expression is 
            substituted into the remaining equations).
            This method works well for simple systems of two equations in two unknowns,
            but becomes complicated if the number or complexity of the equations is increased.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another method is elimination <mdash/> the method that we will adopt in this book.
            Recall that the elimination method works by multiplying each equation by a suitable 
            constant so that the coefficients of one of the variables in each equation is the same.
            Then we subtract corresponding sides of these equations to eliminate that variable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Use the method of elimination to show that this system has the unique solution 
            <m>x_1=3</m> and <m>x_2=2</m>.
            Explain the specific steps you perform when using elimination.

            Recall that a linear equation in two variables can be represented as a line in <m>\R^2</m>,
            the Cartesian plane,
            where one variable corresponds to the horizontal axis and the other to the vertical axis.
            Represent the two equations <m>2x_1 -3x_2 = 0</m> and
            <m>x_1 - x_2= 1</m> in <m>\R^2</m> and illustrate the solution to the system in your picture.

            The previous example should be familiar to you as a system of two equations in two unknowns.
            Now we consider a system of three equations in three unknowns

            that arises from our electrical circuit in <xref ref="F_circuit1again"></xref>,
            with currents <m>I_1</m>,

            the system of linear equations <xref ref="eq_PAcircuit_a"/>,
            <xref ref="eq_PAcircuit_b"/>, and <xref ref="eq_PAcircuit_c"/>.

                  subtracting corresponding sides of this equation from the appropriate sides of 
                  equation <xref ref="eq_PAcircuit_b"/>.
