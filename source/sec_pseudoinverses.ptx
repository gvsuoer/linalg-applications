    Not every matrix is invertible,
    so we cannot always solve a matrix equation <m>A \vx = \vb</m>.
    However, every matrix has a pseudoinverse <m>A^+</m> that acts something like an inverse.
    Even when we can't solve a matrix equation
    <m>A \vx = \vb</m> because <m>\vb</m> isn't in <m>\Col A</m>,
    we can use the pseudoinverse of <m>A</m> to
    <q>solve</q>
    the equation <m>A \vx = \vb</m> with the
    <q>solution</q>
    <m>A^+ \vb</m>.
    While not an exact solution,
    <m>A^+ \vb</m> turns out to be the best approximation to a solution in the least squares sense.
    We will use the singular value decomposition to find the pseudoinverse of a matrix.

            Recall that one property of invertible matrices is that the inverse of a product of invertible matrices is the product of the inverses in the reverse order.
            If <m>A</m> were invertible,
            then <m>A^{-1}</m> would be <m>\left(U \Sigma V^{\tr}\right)^{-1} = V \Sigma^{-1} U^{\tr}</m>.
            Even though <m>U</m> and <m>V</m> are invertible,
            the matrix <m>\Sigma</m> is not.
            But <m>\Sigma</m> does contain non-zero eigenvalues that have reciprocals,
            so consider the matrix <m>\Sigma^+ = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\amp 0 \\ 0\amp 1 \\ 0\amp 0 \end{array} \right]</m>.
            Calculate the products <m>\Sigma \Sigma^+</m> and <m>\Sigma^+ \Sigma</m>.
            How are the results similar to that obtained with a matrix inverse?

            The only matrix in the singular value decomposition of <m>A</m> that is not invertible is <m>\Sigma</m>.
            But the matrix <m>\Sigma^{+}</m> acts somewhat like an inverse of <m>\Sigma</m>,
            so let us define <m>A^+</m> as <m>V \Sigma^+ U^{\tr}</m>.

    Only some square matrices have inverses.
    However, every matrix has a pseudoinverse.
    A pseudoinverse <m>A^{+}</m> of a matrix <m>A</m> provides something like an inverse when a matrix doesn't have an inverse.
    Pseudoinverses are useful to approximate solutions to linear systems.
    If <m>A</m> is invertible,
    then the equation <m>A \vx = \vb</m> has the solution <m>\vx = A^{-1}\vb</m>,
    but when <m>A</m> is not invertible and <m>\vb</m> is not in <m>\Col A</m>,
    then the equation <m>A \vx = \vb</m> has no solution.
    In the invertible case of an <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m>,
    there is a matrix <m>B</m> so that <m>AB = BA = I_n</m>.
    This also implies that <m>BAB = B</m> and <m>ABA = A</m>.
    To mimic this situation when <m>A</m> is not invertible,
    we search for a matrix <m>A^+</m> (a pseudoinverse of <m>A</m>) so that
    <m>AA^+A = A</m> and <m>A^+AA^+ = A^+</m>,
    as we saw in <xref ref="pa_7_d_2"></xref>.
    Then it turns out that <m>A^+</m> acts something like an inverse for <m>A</m>.
    In this case, we approximate the solution to
    <m>A \vx = \vb</m> by <m>\vx^* = A^+\vb</m>,
    and we will see that the vector
    <m>A\vx^* = AA^+\vb</m> turns out to be the vector in <m>\Col A</m> that is closest to <m>\vb</m> in the least squares sense.

    A reasonable question to ask is how we can find a pseudoinverse of a matrix <m>A</m>.
    A singular value decomposition provides an answer to this question.
    If <m>A</m> is an invertible <m>n \times n</m> matrix,
    then 0 is not an eigenvalue of <m>A</m>.
    As a result,
    in the singular value decomposition <m>U \Sigma V^{\tr}</m> of <m>A</m>,
    the matrix <m>\Sigma</m> is an invertible matrix
    (note that <m>U</m>, <m>\Sigma</m>,
    and <m>V</m> are all <m>n \times n</m> matrices in this case).
    So
    <me>
      A^{-1} = \left(U \Sigma V^{\tr}\right)^{-1} = V \Sigma^{-1} U^{\tr}
    </me>,
    where
    <me>
      \Sigma^{-1} = \left[ \begin{array}{ccccc} \frac{1}{\sigma_1}\amp \amp \amp \amp  \\  \amp  \frac{1}{\sigma_2}\amp \amp 0\amp  \\  \amp \amp  \frac{1}{\sigma_3}\amp \amp  \\ \amp 0  \amp  \amp  \ddots \amp   \\ \amp \amp \amp \amp  \frac{1}{\sigma_n} \end{array}  \right]
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this case,
    <m>V \Sigma^{-1} U^{\tr}</m> is a singular value decomposition for <m>A^{-1}</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    To understand in general how a pseudoinverse is found,
    let <m>A</m> be an <m>m \times n</m> matrix with <m>m \neq n</m>,
    or an <m>n \times n</m> with rank less than <m>n</m>.
    In these cases <m>A</m> does not have an inverse.
    But as in <xref ref="pa_7_d_2"></xref>,
    a singular value decomposition provides a pseudoinverse <m>A^+</m> for <m>A</m>.
    Let <m>U \Sigma V^{\tr}</m> be a singular value decomposition of an
    <m>m \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> of rank <m>r</m>, with
    <me>
      \Sigma = \left[ \begin{array}{ccccc|c} \sigma_1\amp \amp \amp \amp \amp  \\ \amp  \sigma_2\amp \amp 0\amp \amp 0 \\ \amp \amp  \sigma_3\amp \amp \amp  \\ \amp  0 \amp  \amp  \ddots \amp  \amp  \\ \amp \amp \amp \amp  \sigma_r \\ \hline \amp \amp 0\amp \amp \amp 0 \end{array}  \right]
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    The matrices <m>U</m> and <m>V</m> are invertible,
    but the matrix <m>\Sigma</m> is not if <m>A</m> is not invertible.
    If we let <m>\Sigma^+</m> be the <m>n \times m</m> matrix defined by
    <me>
      \Sigma^{+} = \left[ \begin{array}{ccccc|c} \frac{1}{\sigma_1}\amp \amp \amp \amp \amp  \\ \amp  \frac{1}{\sigma_2}\amp \amp 0\amp \amp 0 \\ \amp \amp  \frac{1}{\sigma_3}\amp \amp \amp  \\ \amp  0 \amp  \amp  \ddots \amp  \amp  \\ \amp \amp \amp \amp  \frac{1}{\sigma_r} \\ \hline \amp \amp 0\amp \amp \amp 0 \end{array}  \right]
    </me>,
    then <m>\Sigma^{+}</m> will act much like an inverse of <m>\Sigma</m> might.
    In fact, it is not difficult to see that
    <me>
      \Sigma\Sigma^{+} = \left[ \begin{array}{c|c} I_r\amp 0 \\ \hline 0\amp 0 \end{array}  \right] \text{ and }  \Sigma^{+}\Sigma = \left[ \begin{array}{c|c} I_r\amp 0 \\ \hline 0\amp 0 \end{array}  \right]
    </me>,
    where <m>\Sigma\Sigma^{+}</m> is an <m>m \times m</m> matrix and
    <m>\Sigma^{+}\Sigma</m> is an <m>n \times n</m> matrix.

    Pseudoinverses satisfy several properties that are similar to those of inverses.
