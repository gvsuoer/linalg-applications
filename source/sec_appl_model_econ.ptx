  <title>Application: Modeling an Economy</title>
  <p>
    An economy is a very complex system.
    An economy is not a well-defined object,
    there are many factors that influence an economy,
    and it is often unclear how the factors influence each other.
    Mathematical modeling plays an important role in attempting to understand an economy.

    In 1941 Wassily Leontief developed the first empirical model of a national economy.
    Around 1949 Leontief used data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to divide the 
    U.S. economy into 500 sectors.
    He then set up linear equations for each sector.
    This system was too large for the computers at the time to solve,
    so he then aggregated the information into 42 sectors.
    The Harvard Mark II computer was used to solve this system,
    one of the first significant uses of computers for mathematical modeling.
    Leontief won the 1973 Nobel Prize in economics for his work.

    With such large models (Leontief's models are called <term>input-output</term>
    models) it is important to find a shorthand way to represent the resulting systems.
    In this section we will see how to represent any size system of linear equations in a 
    very convenient way.
    Later, we will analyze a small economy using input-output models.
