  <title>The Kernel and Range of Linear Transformation</title>
  <p>
    As we saw in <xref ref="pa_8_a"></xref>,
    any linear transformation sends the additive identity to the additive identity.
    If <m>T</m> is a matrix transformation defined by
    <m>T(\vx) = A \vx</m> for some <m>m \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m>,
    then we have seen that the set of vectors that <m>T</m> maps to the zero vector is <m>\Nul A = \{\vx : A \vx = \vzero\}</m>,
    which is also <m>\Ker(T) = \{\vx : T(\vx) = \vzero\}</m>.
    We can extend this idea of the kernel of a matrix transformation to any linear transformation <m>T</m>.
  </p>

    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>T : V \to W</m> be a linear transformation from the vector space <m>V</m> to the vector space <m>W</m>.
        The <term>kernel</term> of <m>T</m> is the set
        <me>
          \Ker(T) = \{\vx \in V : T(\vx) = \vzero_W\}
        </me>,
        where <m>\vzero_W</m> is the additive identity in <m>W</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    Just as the null space of an
    <m>m \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> is a subspace of <m>\R^n</m>,
    the kernel of a linear transformation from a vector space <m>V</m> to a vector space <m>W</m> is a subspace of <m>V</m>.
    The proof is left to the exercises.

  <theorem xml:id="thm_8_a_ker">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>T : V \to W</m> be a linear transformation from a vector space <m>V</m> to vector space <m>W</m>.
        Then <m>\Ker(T)</m> is a subspace of <m>V</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    The kernel of a linear transformation provides a convenient way to determine if the linear transformation is one-to-one.
    If <m>T</m> is one-to-one,
    then the only solution to <m>T(\vx) = \vzero_W</m> is
    <m>\vzero_V</m> and <m>\Ker(T)</m> contains only the zero vector.
    If <m>T</m> is not one-to-one
    (and the domain of <m>T</m> is not just <m>\{\vzero\}</m>),
    then the number of solutions to
    <m>T(\vx) = \vzero_W</m> is infinite and <m>\Ker(T)</m> contains more than just the zero vector.
    We formalize this idea in the next theorem.
    (Compare to <xref ref="thm_3_b_one_to_one_kernel"></xref>.)
    The formal proof is left for the exercises.

    Recall that the matrix-vector product <m>A \vx</m> is a linear combination of the columns of <m>A</m> and the set of all vectors of the form <m>A \vx</m> is the column space of <m>A</m>.
    For the matrix transformation <m>T</m> defined by <m>T(\vx) = A\vx</m>,
    the set of all vectors of the form <m>A \vx</m> is also the range of the transformation <m>T</m>.
    We can extend this idea to arbitrary linear transformations to define the
    <term>range</term> of a transformation.

  <definition>
  <idx><h>range of a linear transformation</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>T : V \to W</m> be a linear transformation from the vector space <m>V</m> to the vector space <m>W</m>.
        The <term>range</term> of <m>T</m> is the set
        <me>
          \Range(T) = \{T(\vx) : \vx \text{ is in }  V\}
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
  <idx><h>image of a linear transformation</h></idx>
    We also call the range of a transformation <m>T</m> the
    <term>image</term> of the transformation and use the notation <m>\Image(T)</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If <m>T(\vx) = A\vx</m> for some <m>m \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m>,
    we know that <m>\Col A</m>,
    the span of the columns of <m>A</m>,
    is a subspace of <m>\R^m</m>.
    Consequently, the range of <m>T</m>,
    which is also the column space of <m>A</m>,
    is a subspace of <m>\R^m</m>.
    In general, the range of a linear transformation <m>T</m> from <m>V</m> to <m>W</m> is a subspace of <m>W</m>.
    The fact that the range of a transformation is a subspace of the codomain is a consequence of the more general result in the following theorem.
  </p>

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>T : V \to W</m> be a linear transformation from a vector space <m>V</m> to vector space <m>W</m>,
        and let <m>U</m> be a subspace of <m>V</m>.
        Then the set
        <me>
          T(U) = \{T(\vu) : \vu \in U\}
        </me>
        is a subspace of <m>W</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>T : V \to W</m> be a linear transformation from a vector space <m>V</m> to vector space <m>W</m>,
      and let <m>U</m> be a subspace of <m>V</m>.
      Let <m>\vzero_V</m> and <m>\vzero_W</m> be the additive identities in <m>V</m> and <m>W</m>,
      respectively.
      We have already shown that <m>T(\vzero_V) = \vzero_W</m>,
      so <m>\vzero_W</m> is in <m>T(U)</m>.
      To show that <m>T(U)</m> is a subspace of <m>W</m> we must also demonstrate that <m>\vw+\vz</m> is in <m>T(U)</m> whenever <m>\vw</m> and <m>\vz</m> are in <m>T(U)</m> and that <m>a\vw</m> is in <m>T(U)</m> whenever <m>a</m> is a scalar and <m>\vw</m> is in <m>T(U)</m>.
      Let <m>\vw</m> and <m>\vz</m> be in <m>T(U)</m>.
      Then <m>T(\vx) = \vw</m> and
      <m>T(\vy) = \vz</m> for some vectors <m>\vx</m> and <m>\vy</m> in <m>U</m>.
      Since <m>U</m> is a subspace of <m>V</m>,
      we know that <m>\vx+\vy</m> is in <m>U</m>.
      The fact that <m>T</m> is a linear transformation means that
      <me>
        T(\vx + \vy) = T(\vx) + T(\vy) = \vw + \vz
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So <m>\vw+\vz</m> is in <m>T(U)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, let <m>a</m> be a scalar.
      Since <m>U</m> is a subspace of <m>V</m>,
      we know that <m>a \vx</m> is in <m>U</m>.
      The linearity of <m>T</m> gives us
      <me>
        T(a\vx) = aT(\vx) = a\vw
      </me>,
      so <m>a \vw</m> is in <m>T(U)</m>.
      We conclude that <m>T(U)</m> is a subspace of <m>W</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    Letting <m>U = V</m> shows that
    <m>\Range(T)</m> is a subspace of <m>W</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The subspace <m>\Range(T)</m> provides us with a convenient criterion for the transformation <m>T</m> being onto.
    The transformation <m>T</m> is onto if for each <m>\vb</m> in <m>W</m>,
    there is at least one <m>\vx</m> for which <m>T(\vx)=\vb</m>.
    This means that every <m>\vb</m> in <m>W</m> belongs to
    <m>\Range(T)</m> for <m>T</m> to be onto.

      <p>
        A linear transformation <m>T</m> from a vector space <m>V</m> to a vector space <m>W</m> is onto if and only if <m>\Range(T) = W</m>.
