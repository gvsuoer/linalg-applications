  <title>Geometric Interpretation of the Determinant</title>
  <p>
    Determinants have interesting and useful applications from a geometric perspective.
    To understand the geometric interpretation of the determinant of an <m>n\times n</m> matrix <m>A</m>,
    we consider the image of the unit square under the transformation
    <m>T(\vx)=A\vx</m> and see how its area changes based on <m>A</m>.

            Let <m>A = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 2\amp 0\\0\amp 3 \end{array} \right]</m>.
            Start with the unit square in <m>\R^2</m> with corners at the origin and at <m>(1,1)</m>.
            In other words,
            the unit square we are considering consists of all vectors <m>\vv=\left[ \begin{array}{c} x\\y \end{array} \right]</m> where
            <m>0\leq x\leq 1</m> and <m>0\leq y\leq 1</m>,
            visualized as points in the plane.

                  Does the relationship you found above generalize to an arbitrary <m>A = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} a\amp 0\\0\amp b \end{array} \right]</m>?
                  If not, modify the relationship to hold for all diagonal matrices.

                  <m>[0 \ 0]^{\tr}, [1 \ 0]^{\tr}, [0 \ 1]^{\tr}, [1 \ 1]^{\tr}</m> as points first and then connect these images to find the image of the unit square.

    It can be shown that for all
    <m>2\times 2</m> matrices a similar relationship holds.
  </p>

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        For a <m>2\times 2</m> matrix <m>A</m>,
        the area of the image of the unit square under the transformation
        <m>T(\vx)=A\vx</m> is equal to <m>|\det(A)|</m>.
        This is equivalent to saying that
        <m>|\det(A)|</m> is equal to the area of the parallelogram defined by the columns of <m>A</m>.
        The area of the parallelogram is also equal to the lengths of the column vectors of <m>A</m> multiplied by
        <m>|\sin(\theta)|</m> where <m>\theta</m> is the angle between the two column vectors.
      </p>
    </statement>

    There is a similar geometric interpretation of the determinant of a
    <m>3\times 3</m> matrix in terms of volume.
  </p>
  
  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        For a <m>3\times 3</m> matrix <m>A</m>,
        the volume of the image of the unit cube under the transformation
        <m>T(\vx)=A\vx</m> is equal to <m>|\det(A)|</m>.
        This is equivalent to saying that
        <m>|\det(A)|</m> is equal to the volume of the parallelepiped defined by the columns of <m>A</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    The sign of <m>\det(A)</m> can be interpreted in terms of the orientation of the column vectors of <m>A</m>.
