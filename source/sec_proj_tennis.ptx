  <p>
    If a particle of mass <m>m</m> and velocity <m>v</m> is moving in a straight line,
    its kinetic energy <m>KE</m> is given by <m>KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2</m>.
    If, instead,
    the particle rotates around an axis with angular velocity <m>\omega</m>
    (in radians per unit of time),
    its linear velocity is <m>v = r \omega</m>,
    where <m>r</m> is the radius of the particle's circular path.
    Substituting into the kinetic energy formula shows that the kinetic energy of the rotating particle is then <m>KE = \frac{1}{2}\left(mr^2\right) \omega^2</m>.
    The quantity <m>mr^2</m> is called the
    <term>moment of inertia</term>
    of the particle and is denoted by <m>I</m>.
    So <m>KE = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2</m> for a rotating particle.
    Notice that the larger the value of <m>r</m>, the larger the inertia.
    You can imagine this with a figure skater.
    When a skater spins along their major axis with their arms outstretched,
    the speed at which they rotate is lower than when they bring their arms into their bodies.
    The moment of inertia for rotational motion plays a role similar to the mass in linear motion.
    Essentially,
    the inertia tells us how resistant the particle is to rotation.

    To understand the tennis racket effect,
    we are interested in rigid bodies as they move through space.
    Any rigid body in three space has three principal axes about which it likes to spin.
    These axes are at right angles to each other and pass through the center of mass.
    Think of enclosing the object in an ellipsoid <mdash/> the longest axis is the <term>primary</term> axis,
    the middle axis is the <term>intermediate</term> axis,
    and the third axis is the third axis.
    As a rigid body moves through space,
    it rotates around these axes and there is inertia along each axis.
    Just like with a tennis racket,
    if you were to imagine an axle along any of the principal axes and spin the object along that axel,
    it will either rotate happily with no odd behavior like flipping,
    or it won't.
    The former behavior is that of a stable axis and the latter an unstable axis.
    The Tennis Racket Theorem is a statement about the rotation of the body.
    Essentially,
    the Tennis Racket Theorem states that the rotation of a rigid object around its primary and third principal axes is stable,
    while rotation around its intermediate axis is not.
    To understand why this is so,
    we need to return to moments of inertia.
  </p>
  <p>
    Assume that we have a rigid body moving through space.
    Euler's (rotation) equation describes the rotation of a rigid body with respect to the body's principal axes of inertia.
    Assume that <m>I_1</m>, <m>I_2</m>,
    and <m>I_3</m> are the moments of inertia around the primary,
    intermediate,
    and third principal axes with <m>I_1 > I_2 > I_3</m>.
    Also assume that <m>\omega_1</m>, <m>\omega_2</m>,
    and <m>\omega_3</m> are the components of the angular velocity along each axis.
    When there is no torque applied,
    using a principal orthogonal coordinates, Euler's equation tells us that

      <mrow xml:id="eq_Euler_1">I_1 \dot{\omega}_1 \amp = (I_2-I_3) \omega_2 \omega_3</mrow>

    </mdn>.

    (The dots indicate a derivative with respect to time,
    which is common notation in physics.) We will use Euler's equations to understand the Tennis Racket Theorem.

    <introduction>
    <p>
      To start, we consider rotation around the first principal axis.
      Our goal is to show that rotation around this axis is stable.
      That is, small perturbations in angular velocity will have only small effects on the rotation of the object.
      So we assume that <m>\omega_2</m> and <m>\omega_3</m> are small.
      In general, the product of two small quantities will be much smaller,
      so <xref ref="eq_Euler_1"/> implies that <m>\dot{\omega}_1</m> must be very small.
      So we can disregard <m>\dot{\omega}_1</m> in our calculations.

            The equation <xref ref="eq_TRT_de_1"/> is a differential equation because it is an equation that involves derivatives of a function.
            Show by differentiating twice that, if

            (where <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are any scalars),
            then <m>\omega_2</m> is a solution to <xref ref="eq_TRT_de_1"/>.
            (In fact, <m>\omega_2</m> is the general solution to <xref ref="eq_TRT_de_1"/>,
            which is verified in just about any course in differential equations.)

    Equation <xref ref="eq_TRT_de_2"></xref>
    shows that <m>\omega_2</m> is is bounded,
    so that any slight perturbations in angular velocity have a limited effect on <m>\omega_2</m>.
    A similar argument can be made for <m>\omega_3</m>.
    This implies that the rotation around the principal axes is stable <mdash/> slight changes in angular velocity have limited effects on the rotations around the other axes.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can make a similar argument for rotation around the third principal axes.

  <project xml:id="act_TRT_axes3">
    <statement>
    <p>
      In this activity,
      repeat the process from Project Activity to show that rotation around the third principal axis is stable.
      So assume that <m>\omega_1</m> and <m>\omega_3</m> are small,
      which implies by <xref ref="eq_Euler_3"/> implies that
      <m>\dot{\omega}_3</m> must be very small and can be disregarded in calculations.

    Now the issue is why is rotation around the second principal axis different.

      Now assume that <m>\omega_1</m> and <m>\omega_3</m> are small.
      Thus, <m>\dot{\omega}_2</m> is very small by <xref ref="eq_Euler_2"/>,
      and we consider <m>\dot{\omega}_2</m> to be negligible.

            The fact that  the constant multiplier in <xref ref="eq_TRT_de_3"/> is positive instead of negative as in <xref ref="eq_TRT_de_1"/> completely changes the type of solution.
