        A quadratic form on <m>\R^n</m> is a function <m>Q</m> defined by
        <me>
          Q(\vx) = \vx^{\tr} A \vx
        </me>
        for some <m>n \times n</m> symmetric matrix <m>A</m>.

        The Principal Axis Theorem tells us that there is a change of variable
        <m>\vx = P\vy</m> that will remove the cross-product terms from a quadratic form and allow us to identify the form and determine the principal axes for the form.
