        An <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> is orthogonally diagonalizable if there is an orthogonal matrix <m>P</m> such that
        <m>P^{\tr}AP</m> is a diagonal matrix.
        Orthogonal diagonalizability is useful in that it allows us to find a
        <q>convenient</q>
        coordinate system in which to interpret the results of certain matrix transformations.
        Orthogonal diagonalization also a plays a crucial role in the singular value decomposition of a matrix.

        An <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> is symmetric if <m>A^{\tr} = A</m>.
        The symmetric matrices are exactly the matrices that can be orthogonally diagonalized.

        The spectrum of a matrix is the set of eigenvalues of the matrix.
