    In 1202 Leonardo of Pisa
    (better known as Fibonacci)
    published <pubtitle>Liber Abaci</pubtitle>
    (roughly translated as <pubtitle>The Book of Calculation</pubtitle>),
    in which he constructed a mathematical model of the growth of a rabbit population.
    The problem Fibonacci considered is that of determining the number of pairs of rabbits produced in a given time period beginning with an initial pair of rabbits.
    Fibonacci made the assumptions that each pair of rabbits more than one month old produces a new pair of rabbits each month,
    and that no rabbits die.
    (We ignore any issues about that might arise concerning the gender of the offspring.)
    If we let <m>F_n</m> represent the number of rabbits in month <m>n</m>, Fibonacci produced the model
    <men xml:id="eq_Fibonacci">
      F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_{n}
    </men>,
    for <m>n \geq 0</m> where <m>F_0 = 0</m> and <m>F_1 = 1</m>.
    The resulting sequence
    <me>
      1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21, \ldots
    </me>
    is a very famous sequence in mathematics and is called the Fibonacci sequence.
    This sequence is thought to model many natural phenomena such as number of seeds in a sunflower and anything which grows in a spiral form.
    It is so famous in fact that it has a journal devoted entirely to it.
    As a note, while Fibonacci's work <pubtitle>Liber Abaci</pubtitle>
    introduced this sequence to the western world,
    it had been described earlier Sanskrit texts going back as early as the sixth century.

    By definition, the Fibonacci numbers are calculated by recursion.
    This is a very ineffective way to determine entries <m>F_n</m> for large <m>n</m>.
    Later in this section we will derive a fascinating and unexpected formula for the Fibonacci numbers using the idea of diagonalization.
