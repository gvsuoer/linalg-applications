    In many situations (least squares approximations, for example) want to find a vector <m>\vw</m> in a subspace <m>W</m> of <m>\R^n</m> that is the <q>best</q> approximation to a vector <m>\vv</m> not in the subspace. A natural measure of <q>best</q> is to find a vector <m>\vw</m>in <m>W</m> if one exists, such that the distance from <m>\vw</m> to <m>\vu</m> is a minimum. This means we want to find <m>\vw</m> so that the quantity
    <me>
      ||\vw - \vu ||
    </me>
    is as small as possible over all vectors <m>\vw</m> in <m>W</m> To do this, we will need to find a suitable projection of the vector <m>\vv</m> onto the subspace <m>W</m> We have already done this in the case that <m>W = \Span\{\vw_1\}</m> is the span of a single vector -- we can project the vector <m>\vv</m> in the direction of <m>\vw_1</m>. Our goal is to generalize this to project a vector <m>\vv</m> onto an entire subspace in a useful way.

        Let <m>\CB = \{\vw_1, \vw_2\}</m> be a basis for a subspace <m>W</m> of <m>\R^3</m> where <m>\vw_1 = [1 \ 0 \ 0]^{\tr}</m> and <m>\vw_2 = [0 \ 1 \ 0]^{\tr}</m> Note that <m>\CB</m> is an orthonormal basis for <m>W</m> Let <m>\vv = [1 \ 2 \ 1]^{\tr}</m> Note that <m>W</m> is the <m>xy</m>plane and that <m>\vv</m> is not in <m>W</m> as illustrated in <xref ref="F_6_d_o_proj"/>.

          Show that the vector <m>\frac{3}{4} [1 \ 2 \ 0]^{\tr}</m>is in <m>W</m>and find the distance between <m>\vv</m>and <m>\frac{3}{4} [1 \ 2 \ 0]^{\tr}</m>

          Part (4) shows that neither vector <m>\vu_1 = \proj_{\vw_1} \vv</m>nor <m>\vu_2 = \proj_{\vw_2} \vv</m>is the vector in <m>W</m>that is closest to <m>\vv</m> We should probably expect this neither projection uses the fact that the other vector might contribute to the closest vector. Let us instead consider the sum <m>\vu_3 = \vu_1+\vu_2</m> Calculate the components of this vector <m>\vu_3</m>and determine the distance between <m>\vu_3</m>and <m>\vv</m> Which of the three vectors <m>\vu_1</m> <m>\vu_2</m> and <m>\vu_3</m>in <m>W</m>is closest to <m>\vv</m>?

If yes, what relationship do you see?
