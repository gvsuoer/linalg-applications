    In <xref ref="chap_dot_product"></xref>
    we were introduced to inner products in <m>\R^n</m>.
    The concept of an inner product can be extended to vector spaces,
    as we will see in this section.
    This will allow us to measure lengths and angles between vectors and define orthogonality in certain vector spaces.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recall that an inner product on <m>\R^n</m> assigns to each pair of vectors <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> the scalar <m>\langle \vu, \vv \rangle</m>.
    Thus, an inner product on <m>\R^n</m> defines a mapping from <m>\R^n \times \R^n</m> to <m>\R</m>.
    Recall also that an inner product on <m>\R^n</m> is commutative,
    distributes over vector addition,
    and respects scalar multiplication,
    and the inner product of a vector in <m>\R^n</m> by itself is always non-negative and is equal to 0 only when the vector is the zero vector.
    We will investigate this ideas in vector spaces in <xref ref="pa_6_c"></xref>.

      Consider the vector space <m>\pol_2</m> of polynomials of degree less than or equal to <m>2</m> with real coefficients.
      Define a mapping from <m>\pol_2 \times \pol_2</m> to <m>\R</m> by
      <me>
        \langle p(t), q(t) \rangle = \int_0^1 p(t)q(t) \, dt
