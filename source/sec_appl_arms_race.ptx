  <title>Application: Modeling an Arms Race</title>
  <p>
    Lewis Fry Richardson was a Quaker by conviction who was deeply troubled by the major wars 
    that had been fought in his lifetime.
    Richardson's training as a physicist led him to believe that the causes of war were 
    phenomena that could be quantified, studied,
    explained, and thus controlled.
    He collected considerable data on wars and constructed a model to represent an arms race.
    The equations in his model caused him concern about the future as indicated by the 
    following statement:

  <blockquote>
    But it worried him that the equations also showed that the unilateral disarmament of 
    Germany after 1918, enforced by the Allied Powers, combined with the persistent 
    level of armaments of the victor countries would lead to the level of Germany's 
    armaments growing again. In other words, the post-1918 situation was not stable. 
    From the model he concluded that great statesmanship would be needed to prevent an 
    unstable situation from developing, which could only be prevented by a change of policies.

    Analyzing Richardson's arms race model utilizes matrix operations,
    including matrix inverses.
    We explore the basic ideas in Richardson's model later in this section.
