  <title>Project: Least Sqaures Linear Approximation</title>
  
  <p>
    We return to the problem of finding the least squares line to fit the GDP-consumption data. We will start our work in a more general setting, determining the  method for fitting a linear function to fit any data set, like the GDP-consumption data, in the least squares sense. Then we will apply our result to the GDP-consumption data.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Suppose we want to fit a linear function <m>p(x) = mx+b</m>to our data. For the sake of our argument, let us assume the general case where we have <m>n</m>data points labeled as <m>(x_1,y_1)</m>, <m>(x_2, y_2)</m>, <m>(x_3, y_3)</m>,  <m>\ldots</m>, <m>(x_n, y_n)</m>. (In the GDP-consumption data <m>n = 21</m>.) In the unlikely event that the graph of <m>p(x)</m> actually passes through these data points, then we would have the system of equations

        in the unknowns <m>b</m> and <m>m</m>.
      </p>
    </introduction>

    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          As a small example to illustrate, write the system (\ref{eq:LS_system}) using the threepoints <m>(x_1,y_1)= (1,2)</m>, <m>(x_2,y_2) = (3,4)</m>, and <m>(x_3,y_3) = (5,6)</m>. Identify the unknowns and then write this system in the form <m>M \va = \vy</m>. Explicitly identify thematrix <m>M</m> and the the vectors <m>\va</m> and <m>\vy</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </task>

    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Identify the specific matrix <m>M</m> and the specific vectors <m>\va</m> and <m>\vy</m> using the data inTable \ref{T:GDP_consumption}. Explain why the system <m>M \va = \vy</m> is inconsistent.(Remember, we are treating consumption as the independent variable and GDP as the dependentvariable.) What does the result tell us about the data? 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </task>
  </project>

  <p>
    <xref ref="act_ls_no_line"/> shows that the GDP-consumption data does not lie on a line. So instead of attempting to find coefficients <m>b</m> and <m>m</m> that give a solution to this system, which may be impossible, we instead look for a vector <m>\va^*</m> that provides us with something that is <q>close</q> to a solution.
  </p>

  <p>
    If we could find <m>b</m> and <m>m</m> that give a solution to the system <m>M\va = \vy</m>, then <m>M\va - \vy</m> would be zero. If we can't make <m>M\va - \vy</m> exactly equal to the vector <m>\vzero</m>, we could instead try to minimize <m>M\va-\vy</m> in some way. One way is to minimize the length <m>||M\va-\vy||</m> of the vector <m>M\va - \vy</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    If we minimize the quantity <m>||M\va-\vy||</m>, then we will have minimized a function given by a sum of squares. That is, <m>||M\va-\vy||</m> is calculated to be

    <men xml:id="eq_ls_equation">
      \sqrt{(b+mx_1-y_1)^2 + (b+mx_2-y_2)^2 + \cdots + (b+mx_n-y_n)^2}
    </men>.
    
    This is why the method we will derive is called the method of least squares. This method provides us with a vector <q>solution</q> in a subspace that is related to <m>M</m>. We can visualize <m>||M \va - \vy||</m> as in <xref ref="F_GDP_error"/>. In this figure the data points are shown along with a linear approximation (not the best for illustrative purposes). The lengths of the vertical line segments are the summands <m>(b+mx_i-y_i)</m> in <xref ref="eq_ls_equation"/>. So we are trying to minimize the sum of the squares of these line segments.

  <p>
    Suppose that <m>\va^*</m> minimizes <m>||M \va - \vy||</m>. Then the vector <m>M \va^*</m> is the vector that is closest to <m>\vy</m> of all of the vectors of the form <m>M \vx</m>. The fact that the vectors of the form <m>M \vx</m> make a subspace will be useful in what follows. We verify that fact in the next project activity.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be an arbitrary <m>m \times k</m> matrix. Explain why the set <m>C = \{A \vx : \vx \in \R^k\}</m> is a subspace of <m>\R^m</m>. 
      </p>
    </statement>
  </project>

  <p>
    <xref ref="act_ls_subspace"/> shows us that even though the GDP-consumption system <m>M \va = \vy</m> does not have a solution, we can find a vector that is close to a solution in the subspace <m>\{M \vx : \vx \in \R^2\}</m>. That is, find a vector <m>\va^*</m> in <m>\R^{2}</m> such that <m>M \va^*</m> is as close (in the least squares sense) to <m>\vy</m> as we can get. In other words, the error <m>||M \va^* - \vy||</m> is as small as possible. In the following activity we see how to find <m>\va^*</m>.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Let 
        <me>S = \sqrt{(b+mx_1-y_1)^2 + (b+mx_2-y_2)^2 + \cdots + (b+mx_n-y_n)^2}</me>,
        the quantity we want to minimize. The variables in <m>S</m> are <m>m</m> and <m>b</m>, so we can think of <m>S</m> as a function of the two independent variables <m>m</m> and <m>b</m>. The square root makes calculations more complicated, so it is helpful to notice that <m>S</m> will be a minimum when <m>S^2</m> is a minimum. Since <m>S^2</m> is also function of the two variables <m>b</m> and <m>m</m>, the minimum value of <m>S^2</m> will occur when the partial derivatives of <m>S^2</m> with respect to <m>b</m> and <m>m</m> are both <m>0</m> (if you haven't yet taken a multivariable calculus course, you can just assume that this is correct). This yields the equations

        In this activity we solve equations <xref ref="eq_ls_1"/> and <xref ref="eq_ls_2"/> for the unknowns <m>b</m> and <m>m</m>. (Do this in a general setting without using specific values for the <m>x_i</m> and <m>y_i</m>.)

    Use the formulas <xref ref="eq_ls_b"/> and <xref ref="eq_ls_m"/> to find the values of <m>b</m> and <m>m</m> for the regression line to fit the GDP-consumption data in <xref ref="T_GDP_consumption"/>. You may use the fact that the sum of the GDP data is <m>3.5164030 \times 10^6</m>, the sum of the consumption data is <m>2.9233750 \times 10^6</m>, the sum of the squares of the consumption data is <m>8.806564894 \times 10^{11}</m>, and the sum of the products of the GDP and consumption data is <m>1.069946378 \times 10^{12}</m>. Compare to the results the authors obtained in the paper  <articletitle>A Statistical Analysis of GDP and Final Consumption Using Simple Linear Regression, the Case of Romania 1990-2010</articletitle>.
