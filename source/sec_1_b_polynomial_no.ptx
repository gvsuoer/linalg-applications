  <title>Project: A Polynomial Fitting Application: Simpson's Rule</title>

  <p>
    As discussed in the introduction, Simpson's Rule for approximating a definite integral models the
    integrand with a quadratic polynomial on each interval. To better understand this method, we consider
    how to fit a quadratic to three points.
  </p>
  <p>
    <idx><h>polynomial curve fitting</h></idx>
    Suppose we are given a collection of three points in the plane: <m>(x_1, y_1)</m>, <m>(x_2, y_2)</m>
    and <m>(x_3, y_3)</m>. There is exactly one quadratic polynomial <m>p(x)</m> which goes through these
    points, <ie/> there is exactly one quadratic <m>p(x)</m> such that for each <m>x_i</m>,
    <m>p(x_i) = y_i</m>. This is an example of <term>polynomial curve fitting</term>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Suppose our given points are <m>(-1, 2)</m>, <m>(1, 6)</m>, <m>(2, 5)</m>. To fit a quadratic to these
    points, consider a general quadratic of the form <m>p(x) = a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0</m>. By 
    substituting the <m>x</m> value of each of the given points and setting that equal to the <m>y</m>
    value of that point, we find three equations
    <me>
      (-1)^2a_2-a_1+a_0=2 \; , \;  a_2+a_1+a_0=6 \; , \;  (2)^2a_2 +2a_1+a_0=5
    </me>
    
    that give us a system of three equations in the three unknowns <m>a_2</m>, <m>a_1</m>, and <m>a_0</m>:

    <md alignment="alignat">
      <mrow> {}a_2  \amp {}-{}   \amp {}a_1   \amp {}+{}  \amp {}a_0   \amp = 2</mrow>
      <mrow>{}a_2   \amp {}+{}  \amp {}a_1   \amp {}+{}  \amp {}a_0  \amp = 6</mrow>
      <mrow>a_2  \amp {}+{}   \amp {2}a_1  \amp {}+{}   \amp {}a_0   \amp = 5</mrow>
    </md>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This system is the example we considered in <xref ref="pa_1_b"></xref>,
    whose solution is <m>a_2 = -1</m>,
    <m>a_1=2</m>, and <m>a_0 = 5</m>.

    <introduction>
    <p>
      In this activity we model the sine function on the interval <m>[a,b]</m>,
      where <m>a = -\frac{\pi}{2}</m> and <m>b = \pi</m> with a collection of quadratics.
      Let <m>f(x) = \sin(x)</m>.
      We divide the interval <m>[a,b]</m> using 6 partition points. Let
      <m>x_0 = -\frac{\pi}{2}</m>,
      <m>x_1 = -\frac{\pi}{4}</m>,
      <m>x_2 = 0</m>, <m>x_3 = \frac{\pi}{4}</m>,
      <m>x_4 = \frac{\pi}{2}</m>,
      <m>x_5 = \frac{3 \pi}{4}</m>, and <m>x_6 = \pi</m>.
      We need 3 points to determine a quadratic,
      so the interval <m>[a,b]</m> will be partioned into 3 subintervals: <m>[x_0, x_2]</m>,
      <m>[x_2, x_4]</m>, and <m>[x_4,x_6]</m>.

    <xref ref="act_1_b_Simpson_ex_1"/> illustrates how we can model a funciton on an interval using a
    sequence of quadratic functions. Now we apply this polynomial curve fitting technique to derive the
    general formula for Simpson's Rule for approximating definite integrals. The Simpson sum
    <m>S(n)</m> is found by using parabolic arcs to approximate the graph of <m>f</m> on each subinterval
    rather than line segments. This allows Simpson's Rule to more closely approximate the value of the
    definite integral with a smaller number of subintervals, although Simpson's rule requires more
    calculations. Recall that to approximate a definite integral of a runction <m>f</m> on an interval
    <m>[a, b]</m>, we partition <m>[a, b]</m> into equal length subintervals. For Simpson's Rule, we
    partition <m>[a, b]</m> into <m>n = 2m</m> subintervals of equal length <m>\Delta x = \frac{b - a}{n}</m>.
    (Note that we need an even number of subintervals since we have to use three points for each parabola).
    For each <m>k</m> we let <m>x_k = a + k \Delta x</m> and <m>y_k = f(x_k)</m>. We approximate <m>f</m>
    on each subinterval using a quadratic. So we need to find the quadratic <m>Q(x) = c_2 x^2 + c_1 x + c_0</m>
    that passes through two consecutive end points as well as the midpoint of a subinterval. That is,
    we need to find the coefficients of <m>Q</m> so that <m>Q</m> passes through the points
    <m>(x_k, y_k)</m>, <m>(x_{k+2}, y_{k+2})</m>, and the midpoint <m>(x_{k+1}, y_{k+1})</m> on the
    interval <m>[x_k, x_{k+2}]</m> (so that we have three points to which to fit a parabola). Note
    that the length of the interval <m>[x_k, x_{k+2}]</m> is <m>2 \Delta x</m>. To make the
    calculations easier, we will translate our function so that our leftmost point is
    <m>(-r, y_k)</m>. Then the middle point is <m>(0, y_{k+1})</m> and the rightmostpoint is
    <m>(r, y_{k+2})</m> where <m>r = \Delta x</m>.

          is the Simpson's Rule approximation.

  <p>
    Notice that we can rewrite the Simpson's Rule approximation as 
    <md>
      <mrow>\frac{1}{3} \amp (y_0 + 4y_1 + 2y_2 + 4y_3 + 2y_4 + \cdots 2y_{n-2} + 4y_{n-1} + y_n) \Delta x</mrow>
      <mrow> \amp = \frac{2}{3} [2(y_1 + y_3 + \cdots + y_{n-1})] \Delta x</mrow>
      <mrow> \amp \quad + \frac{2}{3} (\frac{y_0 + y_2}{2} + \frac{y_2 + y_4}{2} + \cdots + \frac{y_{n-2} + y_n}{2}) \Delta x</mrow>
      <mrow> \amp = \frac{1}{3}[(y_1 + y_3 + \cdots + y_{n-1})(2 \Delta x)]</mrow>
      <mrow> \amp \quad + \frac{1}{3} (\frac{y_0 + y_2}{2} + \frac{y_2 + y_4}{2} + \cdots + \frac{y_{n-2} + y_n}{2}) (2 \Delta x)</mrow>
      <mrow> \amp = \frac{2 M(n) + T(n)}{3}</mrow>
    </md>,

    where <m>M(n)</m> is the midpoint sum and <m>T(n)</m> is the trapezoid sum using <m>n</m> subdivisions
    of the interval <m>[a, b]</m>. Therefore, the weighted average <m>\frac{2 M(n) + T(n)}{3}</m>
    of the midpoint and trapezoid sums gives an approximation using quadratic functions.
