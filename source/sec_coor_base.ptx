  <title>Bases as Coordinate Systems in <m>\R^n</m></title>
  <p>
    Bases are useful for many reasons.
    A basis provides us with a unique representation of the elements in <m>\R^n</m> as linear combinations of the basis vectors in the coordinate system defined by the vectors.
  </p>
  <p>
    As we saw in <xref ref="pa_3_e"></xref>,
    we can think of a basis <m>\CB</m> of <m>\R^2</m> as determining a coordinate system of <m>\R^2</m>.
    For example, let <m>\CB = \{\vv_1, \vv_2\}</m> where
    <m>\vv_1 = \left[ \begin{array}{r} 2 \\ -2 \end{array} \right]</m> and <m>\vv_2 = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 3 \end{array} \right]</m>.
    The vector <m>\vb = \left[ \begin{array}{r} -4 \\ 12 \end{array} \right]</m> can be written as <m>\vb = -3\vv_1 + 2\vv_2</m>.
    <xref ref="F_3_e_1"></xref>
    shows that if we plot the point that is <m>-3</m> units in the <m>\vv_1</m> direction
    (where a
    <q>unit</q>
    is a copy of <m>\vv_1</m>)
    and <m>2</m> units in the <m>\vv_2</m> direction,
    then the result is the vector from the origin to point defined by <m>\vb</m>.

  <p>
    As discussed in <xref ref="pa_3_e"></xref>,
    we can think of the vectors <m>\vv_1</m> and <m>\vv_2</m> as defining a coordinate system,
    with <m>\Span\{\vv_1\}</m> as the
    <q><m>x</m></q>
    -axis and <m>\Span\{\vv_2\}</m> as the
    <q><m>y</m></q>
    -axis.
    Since <m>\CB</m> is a basis,
    any vector <m>\vb</m> in <m>\R^2</m> can be written uniquely in the form
    <me>
      \vb = x_1 \vv_1 + x_2 \vv_2
    </me>
    and the weights serve as the coordinates of <m>\vb</m> in the <m>\vv_1</m>,
    <m>\vv_2</m> coordinate system.
    We call the vector <m>\left[ \begin{array}{c} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{array}  \right]</m> the
    <em>coordinate vector</em>
    of <m>\vb</m> with respect to the basis <m>\CB</m> and write this vector as <m>[\vb]_{\CB}</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is actually a familiar idea,
    one we have used for years.
    The standard coordinates of a vector
    <m>\va = \left[ \begin{array}{c} a_1 \\ a_2 \end{array} \right]</m> in <m>\R^2</m> are just the coordinates of <m>\va</m> with respect to the standard basis <m>\{\ve_1, \ve_2\}</m> of <m>\R^2</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    While we can draw pictures in <m>\R^2</m>,
    there is no reason to restrict this idea to <m>\R^2</m>.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\CB = \{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_n\}</m> be a basis for <m>\R^n</m> for some positive integer <m>n</m>.
        For any vector <m>\vx</m> in <m>\R^n</m>,
        the <term>coordinate vector</term><idx><h>coordinate vector with respect to a basis in <m>\R^n</m></h></idx> of <m>\vx</m> with respect to <m>\CB</m> is the vector
        <me>
          [\vx]_{\CB} = \left[ \begin{array}{c} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \vdots \\ x_n \end{array}  \right]
        </me>,
        where
        <me>
          \vx = x_1 \vv_1 + x_2 \vv_2 + \cdots + x_n \vv_n
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scalars <m>x_1</m>, <m>x_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
        <m>x_n</m> are the <term>coordinates of the vector</term><idx><h>coordinates with respect to a basis in <m>\R^n</m></h></idx> <m>\vx</m>
        <term>with respect to the basis</term>.
      </p>
    </statement>

    Recall that there is exactly one way to write a vector as a linear combination of basis vectors,
    so there is only one coordinate vector of a given vector with respect to a basis.
    Therefore, the coordinate vector of any vector with respect to a basis is well-defined.

      Let <m>\CS = \{[1 \ 0 \ 0]^{\tr},[0 \ 1 \ 0]^{\tr}, [0 \ 0 \ 1]^{\tr}\}</m> and <m>\CB = \{[1 \ 0 \ 0]^{\tr}, [3 \ 2 \ -1]^{\tr}, [1 \ 1 \ -1]^{\tr}\}</m>.
      Assume that <m>\CS</m> and <m>\CB</m> are bases for <m>\R^3</m>.
      Find <m>\left[\left[ \begin{array}{c} 3\\ 7 \\ 0 \end{array} \right]\right]_{\CS}</m> and <m>\left[\left[ \begin{array}{c} 3\\ 7 \\ 0 \end{array} \right]\right]_{\CB}</m>.
      Note that the coordinate vector depends on the basis that is used.

    <em>IMPORTANT NOTE:</em> We have defined the coordinate vector of a vector <m>\vx</m> in <m>\R^n</m> with respect to a basis
    <m>\CB = \{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_n\}</m> as the vector <m>[x_1 \ x_2 \ \ldots \ x_n]^{\tr}</m> if
    <me>
      \vx = x_1 \vv_1 + x_2 \vv_2 + \cdots + x_n \vv_n
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Until now we have listed a basis as a set without regard to the order in which the basis elements are written.
    That is, the set <m>\{\vv_1, \vv_2\}</m> is the same as the set <m>\{\vv_2, \vv_1\}</m>.
    Notice, however,
    that if we change the order of the vectors in our basis,
    say from <m>\{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_n\}</m> to <m>\{\vv_2, \vv_1, \vv_3, \ldots, \vv_n\}</m>,
    then the coordinate vector of <m>\vx</m> with respect to <m>\CB</m> will be different.
    To avoid this problem,
    when discussing coordinate vectors we will consider our bases to be <em>ordered bases</em>,
    so that the order in which we write the elements in our basis is fixed.
    So, for example, the ordered basis
    <m>\{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_n\}</m> is different than the ordered basis <m>\{\vv_2, \vv_1, \vv_3, \ldots, \vv_n\}</m>.

    Coordinate vectors behave nicely with respect to addition and multiplication by scalars.
    The next activity illustrates this in <m>\R^2</m>.

    suggests that the following theorem is true for coordinate vectors.
    The verification is left to the exercises.
