  <p>
    The decomposition <xref ref="eq_6_b_orth_ddecomp"/> is even simpler if
    <m>\vv_k \cdot \vv_k = 1</m> for each <m>k</m>, that is,
    if <m>\vv_k</m> is a unit vector for each <m>k</m>.
    In this case,
    the denominators are all 1 and we don't even need to consider them.
    We have a familiar example of such a basis for <m>\R^n</m>,
    namely the standard basis <m>\CS = \{\ve_1, \ve_2, \ldots, \ve_n\}</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recall that
    <me>
      \vv \cdot \vv = || \vv ||^2
    </me>,
    so the condition <m>\vv \cdot \vv = 1</m> implies that the vector <m>\vv</m> has norm 1.
    An orthogonal basis with this additional condition is a very nice basis and is given a special name.

    In other words,
    an orthonormal basis is an orthogonal basis in which every basis vector is a unit vector.
    A good question to ask here is how we can construct an orthonormal basis from an orthogonal basis.

          Let <m>\vv_1</m> and <m>\vv_2</m> be orthogonal vectors.
          Explain how we can obtain unit vectors <m>\vu_1</m> in the direction of <m>\vv_1</m> and <m>\vu_2</m> in the direction of <m>\vv_2</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Show that <m>\vu_1</m> and <m>\vu_2</m> from the previous part are orthogonal vectors.

          Use the ideas from this problem to construct an orthonormal basis for <m>\R^3</m> from the orthogonal basis <m>S = \left\{ \left[ \begin{array}{r} -2 \\ 1 \\ -1 \end{array} \right], \left[ \begin{array}{r} 0 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{array} \right], \left[ \begin{array}{r} 1 \\ 1 \\ -1 \end{array} \right] \right\}</m>.

    In general, we can construct an orthonormal basis
    <m>\{\vu_1, \vu_2, \ldots, \vu_m\}</m> from an orthogonal basis
    <m>\CB = \{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_m\}</m> by normalizing each vector in <m>\CB</m>
    (that is, dividing each vector by its norm).
