  <title>Diagonalization</title>
  <p>
    If <m>T : V \to V</m> is a linear transformation,
    one important question is that of finding a basis for <m>V</m> in which the matrix of <m>T</m> has as simple a form as possible.
    In other words,
    can we find a basis <m>\CB</m> for <m>V</m> for which the matrix
    <m>[T]_{\CB}</m> is a diagonal matrix?
    Since any matrices for <m>T</m> with respect to different bases are similar,
    this will happen if we can diagonalize any matrix for <m>T</m>.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>V</m> be a vector space of dimension <m>n</m>.
        A linear transformation <m>T</m> from <m>V</m> to <m>V</m> is
        <term>diagonalizable</term> if there is a basis <m>\CB</m> for <m>V</m> for which
        <m>[T]_{\CB}</m> is a diagonalizable matrix.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    Now the question is, if <m>T</m> is diagonalizable,
    how do we find a basis <m>\CB</m> to that
    <m>[T]_{\CB}</m> is a diagonal matrix?
    Recall that to diagonalize a matrix <m>A</m> means to find a matrix <m>P</m> so that
    <m>P^{-1}AP</m> is a diagonal matrix.

    The general idea for diagonalizing a linear transformation is contained in <xref ref="act_8_c_lt_diag"></xref>.
    Let <m>V</m> be an <m>n</m> dimensional vector space and assume the linear transformation <m>T : V \to V</m> is diagonalizable.
    So there exists a basis <m>\CB = \{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_n\}</m> for which
    <m>[T]_{\CB}</m> is a diagonal matrix.
    To find this basis,
    note that for any other basis <m>\CC</m> we know that
    <m>[T]_{\CC}</m> and <m>[T]_{\CB}</m> are similar.
    That means that there is an invertible matrix <m>P</m> so that <m>P^{-1}[T]_{\CC}P = [T]_{\CB}</m>,
    where <m>P= \underset{\CC \leftarrow \CB}{P}</m> is the change of basis matrix from <m>\CB</m> to <m>\CC</m>.
    So to find <m>\CB</m>,
    we choose <m>\CB</m> so that <m>P</m> is the matrix that diagonalizes <m>[T]_{\CC}</m>.
    Using the definition of the change of basis matrix,
    we then know that each basis vector <m>\vv_i</m> in <m>\CB</m> satisfies <m>[\vv_i]_{\CC}=P[\vv_i]_{\CB}= P \ve_i</m>.
    From this we can find <m>\vv_i</m>.
    Note that a standard basis <m>\CS</m> is often a convenient choice to make for the basis <m>\CC</m>.
    This is the process we used in <xref ref="act_8_c_lt_diag"></xref>.

    Recall that an <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> is diagonalizable if and only if <m>A</m> has <m>n</m> linearly independent eigenvectors.
    We apply this idea to a linear transformation as well,
    summarized by the following theorem.
