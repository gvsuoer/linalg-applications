        <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Set up the augmented matrix for this linear system.

          <solution>
            <p>
              The augmented matrix for this system is
              <me>
                \left[ \begin{array}{crrr|c} 1\amp -1\amp 0\amp 2\amp 1 \\ 2\amp 3\amp -2\amp 5\amp 4 \\ 1\amp -1\amp 1\amp -1\amp 0 \\ 4\amp 1\amp -1\amp 6\amp 5 \end{array}  \right]
              </me>.
            
            </p>
          </solution>
        </task>
        <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Find all solutions to the system using forward elimination.
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              We apply forward elimination,
              first making the entries below the 1 in the upper left all 0.
              We do this by replacing row two with row two minus 2 times row 1, row three with row 
              three minus row 1, and row four with row four minus 4 row one.
              This produces the augmented matrix
              <me>
                \left[ \begin{array}{crrr|r} 1\amp -1\amp 0\amp 2\amp 1 \\ 0\amp 5\amp -2\amp 1\amp 2 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 1\amp -3\amp -1 \\ 0\amp 5\amp -1\amp -2\amp 1 \end{array}  \right]
              </me>.
              Now we eliminate the leading 5 in the fourth row by replacing row four with row four minus row two to obtain the augmented matrix
              <me>
                \left[ \begin{array}{crrr|r} 1\amp -1\amp 0\amp 2\amp 1 \\ 0\amp 5\amp -2\amp 1\amp 2 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 1\amp -3\amp -1 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 1\amp -3\amp -1 \end{array}  \right]
              </me>.
              When we replace row four with row four minus row three,
              we wind up with a row of zeros:
              <me>
                \left[ \begin{array}{crrr|r} 1\amp -1\amp 0\amp 2\amp 1 \\ 0\amp 5\amp -2\amp 1\amp 2 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 1\amp -3\amp -1 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0 \end{array}  \right]
              </me>.
              We see that there is no pivot in column four,
              so <m>x_4</m> is a free variable.
              We can solve for the other variables in terms of <m>x_4</m>.
              The third row shows us that
              <md>
                <mrow>x_3 - 3x_4 \amp = -1</mrow>
                <mrow>x_3 \amp = 3x_4 - 1</mrow>
              </md>.
              The second row tells us that
              <md alignment="alignat">
                <mrow>5x_2 - 2x_3 + x_4 \amp = 2</mrow>
                <mrow>5x_2 \amp = 2x_3 - x_4 + 2</mrow>
                <mrow>5x_2 \amp = 2(3x_4-1) - x_4 + 2</mrow>
                <mrow>5x_2 \amp = 5x_4</mrow>
                <mrow>x_2 \amp = x_4</mrow>
              </md>.
              Finally, the first row gives us
              <md alignment="alignat">
                <mrow>x_1-x_2+2x_4 \amp = 1</mrow>
                <mrow>x_1 \amp = x_2 - 2x_4 + 1</mrow>
                <mrow>x_1 \amp = x_4 - 2x_4 + 1</mrow>
                <mrow>x_1 \amp = -x_4 + 1</mrow>
              </md>.
              So this system has infinitely many solutions,
              with <m>x_1 = -x_4 + 1</m>, <m>x_2 = x_4</m>,
              <m>x_3 = 3x_4 - 1</m>, and <m>x_4</m> is arbitrary.
              As a check, notice that
              <me>
                (-x_4+1) - x_4 + 2x_4 = 1
              </me>
              and so this solution satisfies the first equation in our system.
              You should check to verify that it also satisfies the other three equations.
            </p>

              Suppose, after forward elimination,
              the augmented matrix of the system

              has the form

                    The last row will correspond to an equation of the form <m>0 = h-5</m>.
                    So our system will have no solutions when <m>h \neq 5</m>.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        After applying row operations to the augmented matrix of a system of linear equations,
        each of which describes a plane in 3-space,
        the following augmented matrix was obtained:
        <me>
          \left[ \begin{array}{ccc|r} 1\amp a\amp 0\amp 2 \\ 0\amp 2-2a\amp b\amp -4 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 3-\frac{1}{2}b\amp 1 \end{array}  \right]
        </me>.
      </p>
    </introduction>
        <task>
          <statement>

              Describe, algebraically and geometrically, all solutions
              (if any),
              to this system when <m>a=0</m> and <m>b=2</m>.
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              Throughout,
              we will let the variables <m>x</m>,
              <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> correspond to the first, second,
              and third columns, respectively, of our augmented matrix.
            </p>
            <p>
              When <m>a=0</m> and <m>b=2</m> our augmented matrix has the form
              <me>
                \left[ \begin{array}{ccc|r} 1\amp 0\amp 0\amp 2 \\ 0\amp 2\amp 2\amp -4 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 2\amp 1 \end{array}  \right]
              </me>.
              This matrix corresponds to the system
              <md alignment="alignat">
                <mrow> {}x  \amp {}{}     \amp {}    \amp {}{}    \amp {}     \amp {}= \amp  \ 2\amp {}</mrow>

              </md>
              There are no equations of the form <m>0 = b</m> for a nonzero constant <m>b</m>,
              so the system is consistent.
              There are no free variables, so the system has a unique solution.
              Algebraically, the solution is <m>x = 2</m>,
              <m>z = \frac{1}{2}</m>, and <m>y = -\frac{5}{2}</m>.
              Geometrically,
              this tells us that the three planes given by the original system intersect in a single point.

              The last row corresponds to the equation <m>0 = 1</m>,

              Geometrically,
              this tells us that the three planes given by the original system do not all intersect at any common points.

              There are no rows that correspond to equations of the form <m>0 = c</m> for a nonzero constant <m>c</m>,

              The variable <m>y</m> is a free variable,

              Algebraically, the solutions are <m>y</m> is free,
              is <m>z = -\frac{1}{3}</m>, and <m>x = 2-y</m>.
              Geometrically,
              this tells us that the three planes given by the original system intersect in the line with <m>z = -\frac{1}{3}</m>,
