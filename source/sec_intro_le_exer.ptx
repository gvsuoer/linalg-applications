        In the method of elimination there are three operations we can apply to solve a system of linear equations.
        For this exercise we focus on a system of equations in three unknowns <m>x_1</m>,
        <m>x_2</m>, and <m>x_3</m>,
        but the arguments generalize to a system with any number of variables.
        Consider the general system of three equations in three unknowns
        <md>
          <mrow>{4} 4x_1   \amp {}-{}  \amp 4x_2  \amp {}+{}  \amp 4x_3   \amp = 0</mrow>
          <mrow>4x_1   \amp {}+{}  \amp 2x_2  \amp {}    \amp {}     \amp = 8</mrow>
          <mrow>{}   \amp {}    \amp 2x_2  \amp {}+{}  \amp 5x_3  \amp = 9</mrow>
        </md>.
        The goal of this exercise is to understand why the three operations on a system do not change the solutions to the system.
        Recall that a solution to a system with unknowns <m>x_1</m>,
        <m>x_2</m>,
        and <m>x_3</m> is a set of three numbers,
        one for <m>x_1</m>, one for <m>x_2</m>,
        and one for <m>x_3</m> that satisfy all of the equations in the system.

          <li>
            <p>
              Explain why, if we have a solution to this system,
              then that solution is also a solution to any constant <m>k</m> times the second equation.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Explain why, if we have a solution to this system,
              then that solution is also a solution to the sum of the first equation and <m>k</m> times the third equation for any constant <m>k</m>.

        Alice stopped by a coffee shop two days in a row at a conference to buy drinks and pastries.
        On the first day,
        she bought a cup of coffee and two muffins for which she paid $6.87.
        The next day she bought two cups of coffee and three muffins
        (for herself and a friend).
        Her bill was $11.25.
        Use the method of elimination to determine the price of a cup of coffee,
        and the price of a muffin.
        Clearly explain your set-up for the problem. (Assume you are explaining your solution to someone who has not solved the problem herself/himself).

        On the first day, she bought a cup of coffee,

        Her bill was $12.20.
        The last day she bought a cup of coffee,
        two muffins and two scones, and paid $10.35.

        In a grid of wires in thermal equilibrium,
        the temperature at interior nodes is the average of the temperatures at adjacent nodes.
        Consider the grid as shown in <xref ref="F_Grid"></xref>,
        with <m>x_1</m>, <m>x_2</m>, and <m>x_3</m> the temperatures
        (in degrees Centigrade)
        at the indicated interior nodes,
        and fixed temperatures at the other nodes as shown.
        For example,
        the nodes adjacent to the node with temperature <m>x_1</m> have temperatures of <m>x_2</m>,
        <m>200</m>, <m>0</m>, and <m>0</m>,
        so when the grid is in thermal equilibrium <m>x_1</m> is the average of these temperatures:
        <me>
          x_1 = \frac{x_2+200+0+0}{4}
        </me>.
