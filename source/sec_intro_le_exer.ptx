    <introduction>
      <p>
        In the method of elimination there are three operations we can apply to solve a system of 
        linear equations.
        For this exercise we focus on a system of equations in three unknowns <m>x_1</m>,
        <m>x_2</m>, and <m>x_3</m>,
        but the arguments generalize to a system with any number of variables.
        Consider the general system of three equations in three unknowns
        <md alignment="alignat">
          <mrow> 4x_1   \amp {}-{}  \amp 4x_2  \amp {}+{}  \amp 4x_3   \amp = 0</mrow>
          <mrow>4x_1   \amp {}+{}  \amp 2x_2  \amp {}    \amp {}     \amp = 8</mrow>
          <mrow>{}   \amp {}    \amp 2x_2  \amp {}+{}  \amp 5x_3  \amp = 9</mrow>
        </md>.
        The goal of this exercise is to understand why the three operations on a system do not 
        change the solutions to the system.
        Recall that a solution to a system with unknowns <m>x_1</m>,
        <m>x_2</m>,
        and <m>x_3</m> is a set of three numbers,
        one for <m>x_1</m>, one for <m>x_2</m>,
        and one for <m>x_3</m> that satisfy all of the equations in the system.

          Explain why, if we have a solution to this system,
          then that solution is also a solution to any constant <m>k</m> times the second equation.

          Consider the equations

            k(b_1x_1+b_2x_2 + b_3x_3) = ks

    <statement>
      <p>
        Alice stopped by a coffee shop two days in a row at a conference to buy drinks and pastries.
        On the first day,
        she bought a cup of coffee and two muffins for which she paid $6.87.
        The next day she bought two cups of coffee and three muffins
        (for herself and a friend).
        Her bill was $11.25.
        Use the method of elimination to determine the price of a cup of coffee,
        and the price of a muffin.
        Clearly explain your set-up for the problem. (Assume you are explaining your solution to
        someone who has not solved the problem herself/himself).

        In a grid of wires in thermal equilibrium,
        the temperature at interior nodes is the average of the temperatures at adjacent nodes.
        Consider the grid as shown in <xref ref="F_Grid"></xref>,
        with <m>x_1</m>, <m>x_2</m>, and <m>x_3</m> the temperatures
        (in degrees Centigrade)
        at the indicated interior nodes,
        and fixed temperatures at the other nodes as shown.
        For example,
        the nodes adjacent to the node with temperature <m>x_1</m> have temperatures of <m>x_2</m>,
        <m>200</m>, <m>0</m>, and <m>0</m>,

  <title>True/False Questions</title>
  <introduction>
  <p>
    In many sections you will be given True/False questions.
    In each of the True/False questions,
    you will be given a statement, such as
    <q>if we add corresponding sides of two linear equations,
    then the resulting equation is a linear equation</q>
    and
    <q>one can find a system of two equations in two unknowns that has infinitely many solutions.</q>
    Your task will be to determine the truth value of the statement and to give a brief justification 
    for your choice.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that a <em>general</em> statement is considered <em>true</em>
    only when it is always true.
    For example, the first of the above statements <mdash/>
    <q>if we add corresponding sides of two linear equations,
    then the resulting equation is a linear equation</q>
    <mdash/> is a general statement.
    For this statement to be true,
    the equation we obtain by adding corresponding sides of any two linear equations has to be linear.
    If we can find two equations that do not give a linear equation when combined in this way,
    then this statement is false.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that an <em>existential</em>
    statement is considered <em>true</em>
    if there is at least one example which makes is true.
    For example, the latter of the above statements <mdash/>
    <q>one can find a system of two equations in two unknowns that has infinitely many solutions</q>
    <mdash/> is an existential statement.
    For this statement to be true,
    existence of a system of two equations in two unknowns with infinitely many solutions should suffice.
    If it is impossible to find two such equations,
    then this statement is false.
  </p>
  <p>
    To justify that something always happens or never happens,
    one would need to refer to other statements whose truth is known,
    such as theorems, definitions.
    In particular, giving an <em>example</em>
    of two linear equations that produce a linear equation when we add corresponding sides
    <em>does not justify</em> why the sum of <em>any</em>
    two linear equations is also linear.
    Using the definition of linear equations, however,
    we can justify why this new equation will always be linear:
    each side of a linear equation is linear,
    and adding linear expressions always produces a linear sum.
  </p>
  <p>
    To justify that there are examples of something happening or not happening,
    one would need to give a specific example.
    For example,
    in justifying the claim that there is a system of two equations in two unknowns with infinitely many solutions,
    it is not enough to say
    <q>An equation in two unknowns is a line in the <m>xy</m>-plane,
    so there can be two equations with the same line as their solution.</q>
    In general, you should avoid the words
    <q>can,</q>
    <q>possibly,</q>
    <q>maybe,</q>
    etc., in your justifications.
    Instead, giving an example such as
    <q>The linear system <m>x+y=1</m> and <m>2x+2y=2</m> of two equations in two unknowns has 
    infinitely many solutions since the second equation gives the same line as the first in the 
    <m>xy</m>-plane.</q>
    provides complete justification beyond a reasonable doubt.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each response to a True/False statement should be more than just True or False.
    It is important that you provide
    <em>justification</em> for your responses.
