        If <m>A</m> is an <m>n \times n</m> matrix,
        then <m>A</m> is invertible if there is a matrix <m>B</m> so that <m>AB = BA = I_n</m>.
        The matrix <m>B</m> is called the inverse of <m>A</m> and is denoted <m>A^{-1}</m>.

        An <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> is invertible if and only if <m>A</m> the 
        reduced row echelon form of <m>A</m> is the
        <m>n \times n</m> identity matrix <m>I_n</m>.
      </p>

        To find the inverse of an invertible <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m>,
        augment <m>A</m> with the identity and row reduce.
        If <m>[A \ | \ I_n] \sim [I_n \ | \ B]</m>, then <m>B = A^{-1}</m>.
      </p>

    <li>
      <p>
        If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are invertible <m>n \times n</m> matrices,
        then <m>(AB)^{-1}=B^{-1}A^{-1}</m>.
        Since the inverse of <m>AB</m> exists,
        the product of two invertible matrices is an invertible matrix.

        We can use the algebraic tools we have developed for matrix operations to solve 
        equations much like we solve equations with real variables.
        We must be careful, though,
        to only multiply by inverses of invertible matrices,
        and remember that matrix multiplication is not commutative.
