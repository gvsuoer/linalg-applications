  <title>Application: Population Dynamics</title>
  <p>
    The study of population dynamics <mdash/> how and why people move from one place to another <mdash/> is important to economists.
    The movement of people corresponds to the movement of money,
    and money makes the economy go.
    As an example,
    we might consider a simple model of population migration to and from the state of Michigan.

    According to the

    Michigan Department of Technology, Management, and Budget, from 2011 to 2012,
    approximately 0.05% of the U.S. population outside of Michigan moved to the state of Michigan,
    while approximately 2% of Michigan's population moved out of Michigan.
    A reasonable question to ask about this situation is,
    if these numbers don't change,
    what is the long-term distribution of the US population inside and outside of Michigan
    (under the assumption that the total US population doesn't change.).
    The answer to this question involves eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix.
    More details can be found later in this section.
