  <title>Determining the Number of Solutions of a Linear System</title>
  <p>
    Consider the system
    <md alignment="alignat">
      <mrow> {}x_1   \amp {+}    \amp {2}x_2    \amp {}-{}  \amp {}x_3  \amp {}    \amp {}       \amp {}={}  \amp  \ 0\amp {}</mrow>

    </md>
  </p>
  <p>
    The augmented matrix for this system is
    <me>
      \left[ \begin{array}{ccrr|c} 1 \amp  2 \amp  -1 \amp  0 \amp  0 \\ 0 \amp  1 \amp  0 \amp  -1 \amp  2 \\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  1 \amp  -2 \amp  4 \end{array}  \right]
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that this matrix is already in row echelon form.
    The reduced row echelon form of this augmented matrix is
    <men xml:id="eq_Ex_rref">
      \left[ \begin{array}{cccr|c} 1 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \\ 0 \amp  1 \amp  0 \amp  -1 \amp  2 \\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  1 \amp  -2 \amp  4 \end{array}  \right]
    </men>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since there are leading 1s in the first three columns,
    we can use those entries to write <m>x_1</m>, <m>x_2</m>,
    and <m>x_3</m> in terms of <m>x_4</m>.
    We then choose <m>x_4</m> to be arbitrary and write the remaining variables in terms of <m>x_4</m>.
    Let <m>x_4 = t</m>.
    Solving the third equation for <m>x_3</m> gives us <m>x_3 = 4+2t</m>.
    The second equation shows that <m>x_2 = 2+t</m>,
    and the first that <m>x_1 = 0</m>.
    Each value of <m>t</m> provides a solution to the system,
    so our system has infinitely many solutions.
    These solutions are
    <me>
      x_1 = 0, \ x_2 = 2+t, \ x_3 = 4+2t, \ \text{ and }  \ x_4 = t
    </me>,
    where <m>t</m> can have any value.

      We have seen examples of systems with no solutions,
      one solution, and infinitely many solutions.
      As we will see in this activity,
      we can recognize the number of solutions to a system by analyzing the pivot positions in the 
      augmented matrix of the system.

            Write an example of an augmented matrix in row echelon form so that the last column 
            of the (whole) matrix is a pivot column.
            What is the system of equations corresponding to your augmented matrix?
            How many solutions does your system have?
            Why?

  <p>
    When solving a linear system of equations,
    the free variables can be chosen arbitrarily and we can write the basic variables in terms of 
    the free variables.
    Therefore, the existence of a free variable leads to infinitely many solutions for consistent systems.
    However, it is possible to have a system with free variables which is inconsistent. 
    (Can you think of an example?)
