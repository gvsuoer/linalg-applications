  <title>Determining the Number of Solutions of a Linear System</title>
  <p>
    Consider the system
    <md>
      <mrow>{5} {}x_1   \amp {+}    \amp {2}x_2    \amp {}-{}  \amp {}x_3  \amp {}    \amp {}       \amp {}={}  \amp  \ 0\amp {}</mrow>
      <mrow>{}    \amp {}     \amp {}x_2     \amp {}    \amp {}    \amp {}-{}  \amp {}x_4   \amp {}={}   \amp  \ 2\amp {}</mrow>
      <mrow>{}      \amp {}    \amp {}  \amp {}{}       \amp {}x_3  \amp {}-{}  \amp {2}x_4    \amp {}={}   \amp  \ 4\amp {.}</mrow>
    </md>
  </p>
  <p>
    The augmented matrix for this system is
    <me>
      \left[ \begin{array}{ccrr|c} 1 \amp  2 \amp  -1 \amp  0 \amp  0 \\ 0 \amp  1 \amp  0 \amp  -1 \amp  2 \\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  1 \amp  -2 \amp  4 \end{array}  \right]
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that this matrix is already in row echelon form.
    The reduced row echelon form of this augmented matrix is
    <men xml:id="eq_Ex_rref">
      \left[ \begin{array}{cccr|c} 1 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \\ 0 \amp  1 \amp  0 \amp  -1 \amp  2 \\ 0 \amp  0 \amp  1 \amp  -2 \amp  4 \end{array}  \right]
    </men>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since there are leading 1s in the first three columns,
    we can use those entries to write <m>x_1</m>, <m>x_2</m>,
    and <m>x_3</m> in terms of <m>x_4</m>.
    We then choose <m>x_4</m> to be arbitrary and write the remaining variables in terms of <m>x_4</m>.
    Let <m>x_4 = t</m>.
    Solving the third equation for <m>x_3</m> gives us <m>x_3 = 4+2t</m>.
    The second equation shows that <m>x_2 = 2+t</m>,
    and the first that <m>x_1 = 0</m>.
    Each value of <m>t</m> provides a solution to the system,
    so our system has infinitely many solutions.
    These solutions are
    <me>
      x_1 = 0, \ x_2 = 2+t, \ x_3 = 4+2t, \ \text{ and }  \ x_4 = t
    </me>,
    where <m>t</m> can have any value.

      We have seen examples of systems with no solutions,
      one solution, and infinitely many solutions.
      As we will see in this activity,
      we can recognize the number of solutions to a system by analyzing the pivot positions in the augmented matrix of the system.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Write an example of an augmented matrix in row echelon form so that the last column of the (whole) matrix is a pivot column.
            What is the system of equations corresponding to your augmented matrix?
            How many solutions does your system have?
            Why?
          </p>

        <li>
          <p>
            Consider the reduced row echelon form <xref ref="eq_Ex_rref"/>.
            Based on the columns of this matrix,
            explain how we know that the system it represents is consistent.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The system with reduced row echelon form <xref ref="eq_Ex_rref"/> is consistent.
            What is it about the columns of the coefficient matrix that tells us that this system has infinitely many solutions?

        <li>
          <p>
            Suppose that a linear system is consistent and that the coefficient matrix has <m>m</m> rows and <m>n</m> columns.
            <ol label="i">
              <li>
                <p>
                  If every column of the coefficient matrix is a pivot column,
                  how many solutions must the system have?
                  Why?
                  What relationship must exist between <m>m</m> and <m>n</m>?
                  Explain.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If the coefficient matrix has at least one non-pivot column,
                  how many solutions must the system have?
                  Why?
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>

  </activity>
  <p>
    When solving a linear system of equations,
    the free variables can be chosen arbitrarily and we can write the basic variables in terms of the free variables.
    Therefore, the existence of a free variable leads to infinitely many solutions for consistent systems.
    However, it is possible to have a system with free variables which is inconsistent. (Can you think of an example?)
