  <title>When an Eigenvalue Decomposition Does Not Exist</title>
  <p>
    Recall that an eigenvalue decomposition of a matrix exists if and only if the algebraic multiplicity equals the geometric multiplicity for each eigenvalue.
    In this case,
    the whole space <m>\R^n</m> decomposes into eigenspaces corresponding to the eigenvalues and the matrix acts as scalar multiplication in each eigenspace.
    We consider some cases where such a decomposition exists and some where it does not to notice some differences between the two cases and think of ways to improvise the situation.

      <introduction>
        <p>
          All of the matrices below have only one eigenvalue,
          <m>\lambda = 2</m> and characteristic polynomial
          <m>(\lambda-2)^n</m> where <m>n</m> is the matrix size.
          Therefore, for each case,
          the algebraic multiplicity of this eigenvalue is the size of the matrix.
          Find the geometric multiplicity of this eigenvalue (i.e. the dimension of
          <m>\Nul(A-\lambda I)</m>) in each case below to see how the behavior is different in each case.

          In the examples above,
          the only matrices where the algebraic and geometric multiplicities of the eigenvalue 2 are equal are the diagonal matrices,
          which obviously have eigenvalue decompositions.
          The existence of ones above the diagonal destroys this property.
          However, the positioning of the ones is also strategical.
          By letting ones above the diagonal determine how to split the matrix into diagonal blocks,
          we can categorize the matrices.
          For example, the matrix in part (c) has one big
          <m>3\times 3</m> block with twos on the diagonal and ones above,
          while the matrix in part (d) as a
          <m>2\times 2</m> block at the top left and another
          <m>1\times 1</m> block at the bottom right.
          Determine the blocks for all matrices above,
          and identify the relationship between the number of blocks and the geometric multiplicity.

          For this last problem, we will focus on the matrix <m>B</m> above.
          We know that <m>\vv_1 = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 0 \end{array} \right]</m> is an eigenvector.
          We do not have a second linearly independent eigenvector,
          i.e. a solution to <m>(B-2I_2)\vx=\vzero</m>.
          However, since <m>(B-2I_2)^2=0</m>,
          we know that <m>(B-2I_2)(B-2I_2)\vx = \vzero</m> for any <m>\vx</m>,
          which implies that <m>(B-2I_2)\vx</m> always lies inside the eigenspace corresponding to <m>\lambda=2</m>.
          Find <m>(B-2I_2)\left[ \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 1 \end{array} \right]</m> to verify this works in this particular case.
