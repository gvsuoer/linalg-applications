    One real-life application of eigenvalues and eigenvectors is in analyzing the long-term behavior of
    <em>discrete dynamical systems</em>.
    A <em>dynamical system</em>
        <idx><h>dynamical system</h></idx>
    is a system of variables whose values change with time.
    In discrete systems,
    the change is described by defining the values of the variables at time <m>t+1</m> in terms of the values at time <m>t</m>.
    For example, the discrete dynamical system
    <me>
      y_{t+1} = y_t + t
    </me>
    relates the value of <m>y</m> at time <m>t+1</m> to the value of <m>y</m> at time <m>t</m>.
    This is in contrast with a differential equation<fn>
    A differential equation is an equation that involves one or more derivatives of a function.
    </fn> such as
    <me>
      \frac{dy}{dt} = y+t
    </me>,
    which describes the instantaneous rate of change of <m>y(t)</m> in terms of <m>y</m> and <m>t</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Discrete dynamical systems can be used in population modeling to provide a simplified model of predator-prey interactions in biology
    (see Preview <xref ref="pa_2_b_2">Activity</xref>).
    Other applications include Markov chains
    (see <xref ref="ex_2_b_Markov">Exercise</xref>),
    age structured population growth models,
    distillation of a binary ideal mixture of two liquids,
    cobweb model in economics concerning the interaction of supply and demand for a single good,
    queuing theory and traffic flow.

            Consider a discrete dynamical system providing a simplified model of predator-prey interactions in biology,
            such as the system describing the populations of rabbits and foxes in a certain area.
            Suppose, for example,
            for a specific area the model is given by the following equations:
            <men xml:id="eq_PA5_1_3">
              \begin{alignedat}{4} r_{k+1}  \amp {}={}   \amp {1.14}r_k   \amp {}-{}  \amp {0.12}f_k \\ f_{k+1}  \amp {}={}   \amp {0.08}r_k   \amp {}+{}  \amp {0.86}f_k \end{alignedat}
            </men>
            where <m>r_i</m> represents the number of rabbits in the area <m>i</m> years after a starting time value,
            and <m>f_i</m> represents the number of foxes in year <m>i</m>.
            We use <m>r_0, f_0</m> to denote the initial population values.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Suppose <m>r_k=300</m> and <m>f_k=100</m> for one year.
                  Calculate rabbit and fox population values for the next year.
                  In other words, find <m>r_{k+1}, f_{k+1}</m> values.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Consider the coefficients of the variables
                  <m>r_k, f_k</m> in the the system of equations in <xref ref="eq_PA5_1_3"/>.
                  Can you explain the reasoning behind the signs and absolute sizes of the coefficients from the story that it models?
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Let <m>\vx_k=\left[ \begin{array}{c} r_k \\ f_k \end{array}  \right]</m>.
                  The vector <m>\vx_k</m> is called the <em>state vector</em>
                  of the system at time <m>k</m>,
                  because it describes the state of the whole system at time <m>k</m>.
                  We can rewrite the system of equations in <xref ref="eq_PA5_1_3"/> as a matrix-vector equation in terms of the state vectors at time <m>k</m> and <m>k+1</m>.
                  More specifically, the equation will be of the form
                  <men xml:id="eq_PA5_1_4">
                    \vx_{k+1} = A\vx_k
                  </men>
                  where <m>A = \left[ \begin{array}{cr} 1.14 \amp  -0.12 \\ 0.08 \amp  0.86 \end{array}  \right]</m>.
                  We will call this matrix the <em>transition matrix</em> of the system.
                  Check that <m>A \left[ \begin{array}{c} 300\\100 \end{array}  \right]</m> gives us the population values you calculated in the first part above.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  The transition matrix will help us simplify calculations of the population values.
                  Note that equation <xref ref="eq_PA5_1_4"/> implies that <m>\vx_1 = A\vx_0</m>,
                  <m>\vx_2=A\vx_1</m>, <m>\vx_3=A\vx_2</m>, and so on.
                  This is a recursive method to find the population values as each year's population values depend on the previous year's population values.
                  Using this approach,
                  calculate <m>\vx_k</m> for <m>k</m> values up to 5 corresponding to the following
                  <em>three different</em>
                  initial rabbit-fox population values (all in thousands):
                  <me>
                    r_0=300 \;,\;  f_0=100
                  </me>
                  <me>
                    r_0=100 \;,\;  f_0=200
                  </me>
                  <me>
                    r_0=1200 \;,\; f_0=750
                  </me>
                  Can you guess the long-term behavior of the population values in each case?
                  Are they both increasing?
                  Decreasing?
                  One increasing, one decreasing?
                  How do the rabbit and fox populations compare?
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>

    A dynamical system is a system of variables whose values change with time.
    In Preview <xref ref="pa_2_b_2">Activity</xref>,
    we considered the discrete dynamical system modeling the rabbit and fox population in an area,
    which is an example of a predator-prey system.
    The system was given by the equations from <xref ref="eq_PA5_1_3"/>,
    where <m>r_i</m> represented the number of rabbits in the area <m>i</m> years after a starting time value,
    and <m>f_i</m> represented the number of foxes in year <m>i</m>.
    In this notation,
    <m>r_0, f_0</m> corresponded to the initial population values.
  </p>
  <p>
    As we saw in Preview <xref ref="pa_2_b_2">Activity</xref>,
    if we define the state vector
        <idx><h>state vector</h></idx>
    as <m>\vx_k=\begin{bmatrix}r_k \\ f_k \end{bmatrix}</m>,
    the system of equations representing the dynamical system can be expressed as
    <men xml:id="eq_state_vector_recursive_formula">
      \vx_{k+1} = A \vx_k
    </men>
    where <m>A=\left[ \begin{array}{cr} 1.14 \amp  -0.12 \\ 0.08 \amp  0.86 \end{array}  \right]</m> represents the transition matrix.
    Note that equation <xref ref="eq_state_vector_recursive_formula"/> encodes infinitely many equations including <m>\vx_1 = A\vx_0</m>,
    <m>\vx_2=A\vx_1</m>, <m>\vx_3=A\vx_2</m>, and so on.
    This is a recursive formula for the population values as each year's population values are expressed in terms of the previous year's population values.
    If we want to calculate <m>\vx_{10}</m>,
    this formula requires first finding the population values for years 1-9.
    However, we can obtain a non-recursive formula using matrix algebra.
    If we substitute <m>\vx_1 = A\vx_0</m> into
    <m>\vx_2=A\vx_1</m> and simplify, we find that
    <me>
      \vx_2=A\vx_1= A(A\vx_0) = A^2 \vx_0 \,
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Similarly, substituting <m>\vx_2=A^2\vx_1</m> into the formula for <m>\vx_3</m> gives
    <me>
      \vx_3 = A\vx_2=A(A^2 \vx_0) = A^3 \vx_0 \,
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This process can be continued inductively to show that
    <men xml:id="eq_state_vector_closed_formula">
      \vx_k=A^k \vx_0
    </men>
    for every <m>k</m> value.
    So to find the population values at any year <m>k</m>,
    we only need to know the initial state vector <m>\vx_0</m>.

  <activity xml:id="act_dynamical_system">
    <p>
      In this activity the matrix <m>A</m> is the transition matrix for the rabbit and fox population model,
      <me>

            In this case,
            explain why <m>\vx_1=\lambda \vx_0</m> and <m>\vx_2=\lambda^2 \vx_0</m>.

            The initial state vector <m>\vx_0=\left[ \begin{array}{c} 300\\100 \end{array} \right]</m> is an eigenvector of <m>A</m>.
            Find the corresponding eigenvalue and,
            using your formula from (a) for <m>\vx_k</m> in terms of

            Consider now an initial state vector of the form

            <m>\lambda_2</m> (<m>\vv_0</m> and <m>\vw_0</m> are not necessarily the eigenvectors from parts (b) and (c)).
            Use matrix algebra and equation <xref ref="eq_state_vector_closed_formula"/> to explain why <m>\vx_k=a\lambda_1^k\vv_0+b\lambda_2^k\vw_0</m>.

    As you discovered in <xref ref="act_dynamical_system">Activity</xref>,
    we can use linearly independent eigenvectors of the transition matrix to find a closed formula for the state vector of a dynamical system,
