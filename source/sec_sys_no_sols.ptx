  <title>Linear Systems with No Solutions</title>
  <p>
    We saw in the previous section that geometrically two parallel and distinct lines represent a 
    linear system with two equations in two unknowns which has no solution.
    Similarly, two parallel and distinct planes in three dimensions represent a linear system with 
    two equations in three unknowns which has no solution.
    We can have at least four different geometric configurations of three planes in three dimensions 
    representing a system with no solution.
    But how do these geometrical configurations manifest themselves algebraically?

            Apply the elimination process to the augmented matrix of this system.
            Write the system of equations that corresponds to the final reduced matrix.

            Discuss which feature in the final simplified system makes it easy to determine that the system has no solution.
            Similarly, what features in the matrix representation makes is easy to see the system has no solution?

    We summarize our observations about when a system has a solution,
    and which of those cases has a unique solution.

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A linear system is consistent if after the elimination process there is no equation of the 
        form <m>0=b</m> where <m>b</m> is a non-zero number.
        If a linear system is consistent and has a free variable,
        then it has infinitely many solutions.
        If it is consistent and has no free variables,
        then there is a unique solution.
