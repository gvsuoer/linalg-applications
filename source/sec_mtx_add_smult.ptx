  <title>Properties of Matrix Addition and Multiplication by Scalars</title>
  <p>
    Just as we were able to define an algebra of vectors with addition and multiplication by scalars,
    we can define an algebra of matrices.
    We will see that the properties of these operations on matrices are immediate generalizations 
    of the properties of the operations on vectors.
    We will then see how the matrix product arises through the connection of matrices to linear 
    transformations.
    Finally, we define the transpose of a matrix.
    The transpose of a matrix will be useful in applications such as graph theory and 
    least-squares fitting of curves,
    as well as in advanced topics such as inner product spaces and the dual space of a 
    vector space.

    We learned in <xref ref="pa_2_a"></xref>
    that we can add two matrices of the same size together by adding corresponding entries 
    and we can multiply any matrix by a scalar by multiplying each entry of the matrix by 
    that scalar.
    More generally, if <m>A = [a_{ij}]</m> and <m>B = [b_{ij}]</m> are
    <m>m \times n</m> matrices and <m>c</m> is any scalar, then
    <me>
      A + B = [a_{ij}+b_{ij}] \ \ \text{ and }  \ \ cA = [ca_{ij}]
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    As we have done each time we have introduced a new operation,
    we ask what properties the operation has.
    For example,
    you determined in <xref ref="pa_2_a"></xref>
    that addition of matrices is a commutative operation.
    More specifically, for every two
    <m>m\times n</m> matrices <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, <m>A+B=B+A</m>.
    We can use similar arguments to verify the following properties of matrix addition 
    and multiplication by scalars.
    Notice that these properties are very similar to the properties of addition and scalar 
    multiplication of vectors we discussed earlier.
    This should come as no surprise since the <m>n</m>-dimensional vectors are <m>n\times 1</m> 
    matrices.
    In a strange twist,
    we will see that matrices themselves can be considered as vectors when we discuss vector 
    spaces in a later section.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m> be
        <m>m \times n</m> matrices and let <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> be scalars.
        Then

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>A+B = B+A</m> (this property tells us that matrix addition is <term>commutative</term>)

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>(A+B) + C = A + (B+C)</m> (this property tells us that matrix addition is 
              <term>associative</term>)

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The <m>m \times n</m> matrix <m>0</m> whose entries are all 0 has the property 
              that <m>A + 0 = A</m>.
              The matrix <m>0</m> is called the <term>zero matrix</term>
              (It is generally clear from the context what the size of the 0 matrix is.).

          <li>
            <p>
              The scalar multiple <m>(-1)A</m> of the matrix <m>A</m> has the property that 
              <m>(-1)A + A = 0</m>.
              The matrix <m>(-1)A = -A</m> is called the
              <term>additive inverse</term> of the matrix <m>A</m>.

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>(a+b) A = aA + bA</m> (this property tells us that
              <em>scalar multiplication of matrices distributes over scalar addition</em>)

          <li>

  </theorem>
  <p>
    Later on, we will see that these properties define the set of all
    <m>m \times n</m> matrices as a <term>vector space</term>.
    These properties just say that,
    regarding addition and multiplication by scalars,
    we can manipulate matrices just as we do real numbers.
    Note, however,
    we have not yet defined an operation of multiplication on matrices.
    That is the topic for the next section.
