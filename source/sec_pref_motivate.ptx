  <p>
    The material in this text was developed with a strong focus on linear algebra in <m>\R^n</m> for the first two-thirds of the course,
    along with an emphasis on applications.
    We believe that the main ideas of linear algebra are more accessible to students if they are introduced in the more familiar context of vectors in <m>\R^n</m> rather than in abstract vector spaces.
    For this reason, vector spaces do no arise until late in the text.
