    Consider the problem of finding the area of a parallelogram determined by two vectors <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m>,
    as illustrated at left in <xref ref="F_det_area"></xref>.
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="F_det_area">
    <caption>A parallelogram and a parallelepiped.</caption>
    <sidebyside>
    <image width="30%" source="det_area_2"/>   <image width="30%" source="det_volume_2"/>
    </sidebyside>
  </figure>
  <p>
    We could calculate this area, for example,
    by breaking up the parallelogram into two triangles and a rectangle and finding the area of each.
    Now consider the problem of calculating the volume of the three-dimensional analog
    (called a <term>parallelepiped</term>)
    determined by three vectors <m>\vu</m>, <m>\vv</m>,
    and <m>\vw</m> as illustrated at right in <xref ref="F_det_area"></xref>.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is quite a bit more difficult to break this parallelepiped into subregions whose volumes are easy to compute.
    However, all of these computations can be made quickly by using determinants.
    The details are later in this section.
