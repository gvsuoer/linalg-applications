        A finite dimensional vector space is a vector space that can be spanned by a finite set of vectors.

        We showed that any two bases for a finite dimensional vector space <em>must</em>
        contain the same number of vectors.
        Therefore, we can define the <em>dimension</em>
        of a finite dimensional vector space <m>V</m> to be the number of vectors in any basis for <m>V</m>.

        If <m>V</m> is a vector space with dimension <m>n</m> and <m>S</m> is any linearly independent subset of <m>V</m> with <m>n</m> vectors,
        then <m>S</m> is a basis for <m>V</m>.
        Otherwise, we could add vectors to <m>S</m> to make a basis for <m>V</m> and then <m>V</m> would have a basis of more than <m>n</m> vectors.

        If <m>V</m> is a vector space with dimension <m>n</m> and <m>S</m> is any subset of <m>V</m> with <m>n</m> vectors that spans <m>V</m>,
        then <m>S</m> is a basis for <m>V</m>.
        Otherwise, we could remove vectors from <m>S</m> to obtain a basis for <m>V</m> and then <m>V</m> would have a basis of fewer than <m>n</m> vectors.
