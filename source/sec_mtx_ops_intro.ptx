  <p>
    A vector is a list of numbers in a specified order and a matrix is an ordered array of objects.
    In fact, a vector can be thought of as a matrix of size <m>n \times 1</m>.
    Vectors and matrices are so alike in this way that it would seem natural that we can 
    define operations on matrices just as we did with vectors.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recall that a matrix is made of rows and columns <mdash/> the entries reading from 
    left to right form the <em>rows</em>
    of the matrix and the entries reading from top to bottom form the <term>columns</term>.
    The number of rows and columns of a matrix is called the
    <term>size</term> of the matrix,
    so an <m>m \times n</m> matrix has <m>m</m> rows and <m>n</m> columns.
    If we label the entry in the <m>i</m>th row and <m>j</m>th column of a matrix 
    <m>A</m> as <m>a_{ij}</m>,
    then we write <m>A = [a_{ij}]</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can generalize the operations of addition and scalar multiplication on vectors to 
    matrices similarly.
    Given two matrices <m>A=[a_{ij}]</m> and <m>B=[b_{ij}]</m> of the same size,
    we define the sum <m>A+B</m> by
    <me>
      A+B= [ a_{ij}+b_{ij} ]
    </me>
    when the sizes of the matrices <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> match.
    In other words,
    for matrices of the same size the matrix addition is defined by adding 
    corresponding entries in the matrices.
    For example,
    <me>
      \left[ \begin{array}{rc} 1 \amp  2 \\ -2 \amp  3 \end{array}  \right] + \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 1 \amp  3 \\ 2 \amp  4 \end{array}  \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 2 \amp  5 \\ 0 \amp  7 \end{array}  \right]  \,
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
  <idx><h>matrix</h><h>scalar multiple</h></idx>
    We define the scalar multiple of a matrix
    <m>A=[a_{ij}]</m> by scalar <m>c</m> to be the matrix <m>cA</m> defined by
    <me>
      cA= [ ca_{ij}]
    </me>,
  </p>
  <p>
    This means that we multiply each entry of the matrix <m>A</m> by the scalar <m>c</m>.
    As an example,
    <me>
      3 \left[ \begin{array}{rc} 1 \amp  2 \\ -2 \amp  3 \end{array}  \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{rc} 3 \amp  6 \\ -6 \amp  9 \end{array}  \right] \,
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even though we did not have a multiplication operation on vectors,
    we had a matrix-vector product,
    which is a special case of a matrix-matrix product since a vector is a matrix with one column.
    However, generalizing the matrix-vector product to a matrix-matrix product is not 
    immediate as it is not immediately clear what we can do with the other columns.
    We will consider this question in this section.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that all of the matrix operations can be performed on a calculator.
    After entering each matrix in the calculator, just use <m>+</m>,
    <m>-</m> and <times/> operations to find the result of the matrix operation.
    (Just for fun,
    try using <m>\div</m> with matrices to see if it will work.)

        <introduction>
          <p>
            Now we turn to multiplication of matrices.
            Our first goal is to find out what conditions we need on the sizes of 
            matrices <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> if the matrix-matrix product <m>AB</m> is 
            defined and what the size of the resulting product matrix is.
            We know the condition and the size of the result in the special case of <m>B</m> 
            being a vector,
            i.e., a matrix with one column.
            So our conjectures for the general case should match what we know in the special case.
            In each part of this problem,
            use any appropriate tool (e.g., your calculator, Maple, Mathematica, 
            Wolfram<m>|</m>Alpha) to determine the matrix product <m>AB</m>,
            if it exists.
            If you obtain a product,
            write it down and explain how its size is related to the sizes of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.
            If you receive an error,
            write down the error and guess why the error occurred and/or what it means.

            The final matrix products, when defined,

            might seem unrelated to the individual matrices at first.
            In this problem,
            we will uncover this relationship using our knowledge of the matrix-vector product.
