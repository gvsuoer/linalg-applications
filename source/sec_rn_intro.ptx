    The set <m>\R^n</m> with vector addition and scalar multiplication has a nice algebraic structure.
    These operations satisfy a number of properties,
    such as associativity and commutativity of vector addition,
    the existence of an additive identity and additive inverse,
    distribution of scalar multiplication over vector addition,
    and others.
    These properties make it easier to work with the whole space since we can express the vectors as linear combinations of basis vectors in a unique way.
    This algebraic structure makes <m>\R^n</m> a <term>vector space</term>.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are many subsets of <m>\R^n</m> that have this same structure.
    These subsets are called <term>subspaces</term> of <m>\R^n</m>.
    These are the sets of vectors for which the addition of any two vectors is defined within the set,
    the scalar multiple of any vector by any scalar is defined within the set and the set contains the zero vector.
    One type of subset with this structure is the span of a set of vectors.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recall that the span of a set of vectors
    <m>\{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_k\}</m> in <m>\R^n</m> is the set of all linear combinations of the vectors.
    For example,
    if <m>\vv_1=\left[ \begin{array}{c} 1\\1\\0 \end{array}  \right]</m> and <m>\vv_2=\left[ \begin{array}{c} 1\\0\\1 \end{array}  \right]</m>,
    then a linear combination of these two vectors is of the form
    <me>
      c_1 \vv_1 + c_2 \vv_2 = c_1 \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1\\1\\0 \end{array}  \right] + c_2 \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1\\0\\1 \end{array}  \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c} c_1+c_2 \\c_1 \\c_2 \end{array}  \right] \,
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    One linear combination can be obtained by letting <m>c_1=2, c_2=-3</m>,
    which gives the vector <m>2\vv_1-3\vv_2=\left[ \begin{array}{c} -1\\-3\\2 \end{array} \right]</m>.
    All such linear combinations form the span of the vectors <m>\vv_!</m> and <m>\vv_2</m>.
    In this case,
    these vectors will form a plane through the origin in <m>\R^3</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now we will investigate if the span of two vectors form a subspace,
    i.e. if it has the same structure as a vector space.
