    We have seen that the eigenvalues of an
    <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> are the scalars <m>\lambda</m> so that
    <m>A - \lambda I_n</m> has a nontrivial null space.
    Since a matrix has a nontrivial null space if and only if the matrix is not invertible,
    we can also say that <m>\lambda</m> is an eigenvalue of <m>A</m> if
    <men xml:id="eq_PA5_2_1">
      \det(A - \lambda I_n) = 0
    </men>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This equation is called the <em>characteristic equation</em> of <m>A</m>.
    It provides us an <em>algebraic</em> way to find eigenvalues,
    which can then be used in finding eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.
    Suppose we want to find the eigenvalues of <m>A=\left[ \begin{array}{cc} 1 \amp  1 \\ 1\amp  3 \end{array}  \right]</m>.
    Note that
    <me>
      A- \lambda I_2 = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 1-\lambda \amp  1 \\ 1\amp  3-\lambda \end{array}  \right]\,
    </me>,
    with determinant <m>(1-\lambda)(3-\lambda)-1=\lambda^2-4\lambda+2</m>.
    Hence, the eigenvalues <m>\lambda_1, \lambda_2</m> are the solutions of the characteristic equation <m>\lambda^2-4\lambda+2=0</m>.
    Using quadratic formula,
    we find that <m>\lambda_1=2+\sqrt{2}</m> and <m>\lambda_2=2-\sqrt{2}</m> are the eigenvalues.

    In this activity,
    our goal will be to use the characteristic equation to obtain information about eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix with real entries.

            For each of the following parts,
            use the characteristic equation to determine the eigenvalues of <m>A</m>.
            Then, for each eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m>,
            find a basis of the corresponding eigenspace,
            i.e., <m>\Nul(A-\lambda I)</m>.
            You might want to recall how to find a basis for the null space of a matrix from <xref ref="sec_null_space">Section</xref>.
            Also, make sure that your eigenvalue candidate <m>\lambda</m> yields nonzero eigenvectors in
            <m>\Nul(A-\lambda I)</m> for otherwise <m>\lambda</m> will not be an eigenvalue.
