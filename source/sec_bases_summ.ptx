    The important idea in this section is that of a basis for a vector space.
    A basis is a minimal spanning set and another equivalent characterization of the
    <q>minimal</q>
    property is linear independence.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          A set <m>\{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_k\}</m> of vectors in a vector space <m>V</m> is linearly independent if the vector equation
          <me>
            x_1 \vv_1 + x_2 \vv_2 + \cdots + x_k \vv_k = \vzero
          </me>
          for scalars <m>x_1, x_2, \ldots,
          x_k</m> has only the trivial solution
          <me>
            x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = \cdots = x_k = 0
          </me>.
          If a set of vectors is not linearly independent,
          then the set is linearly dependent.

        <p>
          A set <m>\{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_k\}</m> of vectors in a vector space <m>V</m> is linearly independent if and only if none of the vectors in the set can be written as a linear combination of the remaining vectors in the set.
        </p>

        <p>
          A set <m>\{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_k\}</m> of vectors in a vector space <m>V</m> is linearly dependent if and only if at least one of the vectors in the set can be written as a linear combination of the remaining vectors in the set.

          A basis for a vector space <m>V</m> is a subset <m>S</m> of <m>V</m> if
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>\Span \ S = V</m> and
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>S</m> is a linearly independent set.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </li>

          A basis is important in that it provides us with an efficient way to represent any vector in the vector space <mdash/> any vector can be written in one and only one way as a linear combination of vectors in a basis.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          To find a basis of a vector space,
          we can start with a spanning set <m>S</m> and toss out any vector in <m>S</m> that can be written as a linear combination of the remaining vectors in <m>S</m>.
          We repeat the process with the remaining subset of <m>S</m> until we arrive at a linearly independent spanning set.
          Alternatively,
          we can find a spanning set for the space and remove any vector that is a linear combination of the others in the spanning set.
          We can repeat this process until we wind up with a linearly independent spanning set.
