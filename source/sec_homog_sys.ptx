  <title>Homogeneous and Nonhomogeneous Systems</title>
  <p>
    As we saw before,
    the systems with all the right hand side constants being 0 are special in that they 
    always have a solution. (Why?) So we might consider grouping systems into two types: 
    Those of the form <m>A \vx = \vb</m>,
    where not all of the entries of the vector <m>\vb</m> are <m>0</m>,
    and those of the form <m>A \vx = \vzero</m>,
    where <m>\vzero</m> is the vector of all zeros.
    Systems like <m>A \vx = \vb</m>,
    where <m>\vb</m> contains at least one non-zero entry,
    are called <term>nonhomogeneous</term> systems,
    and systems of the form <m>A \vx = \vzero</m> are called
    <term>homogeneous</term> systems.
    For every nonhomogeneous system
    <m>A \vx = \vb</m> there is a corresponding homogeneous system <m>A \vx = \vzero</m>.
    We now investigate the connection between the solutions to the nonhomogeneous system 
    and the corresponding homogeneous system.

      In this activity we will consider the relationship between the solution sets of 
      nonhomogeneous systems and those of the corresponding homogeneous systems.

            What are the similarities/differences between solutions of the nonhomogeneous 
            system and its homogeneous counterpart?
          </p>
        </statement>
      </task>
  
  </activity>
  <p>
    As we saw in the above activity,
    there is a relationship between solutions of a nonhomogeneous and the corresponding 
    homogeneous system.
    Let us formalize this relationship.
    If the general solution of a system involves free variables,
    we can represent the solutions in
    <term>parametric vector form</term>
    to have a better idea about the geometric representation of the solution set.
    Suppose the solution is that <m>x_3</m> is free,
    <m>x_2 = -2+x_3</m>, and <m>x_1 = 2-3x_3</m>.
    In vector form, we can represent this general solution as
    <men>
      \left[ \begin{array}{c} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{array}  \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 2-3x_3 \\ x_3-2 \\ x_3 \end{array}  \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{r} 2 \\ -2 \\ 0 \end{array}  \right] + x_3\left[ \begin{array}{r} -3 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{array}  \right]
    </men>.
  </p>
  <p>
    From this representation,
    we see that the solution set is a line through the origin
    (formed by multiples of <m>\left[ \begin{array}{r} -3 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{array} \right]</m>)
    shifted by the added vector <m>\left[ \begin{array}{r} 2 \\ -2 \\ 0 \end{array} \right]</m>.
    The solution to the homogeneous system on the other does not have the shift.
  </p>
  <p>
    Algebraically,
    we see that every solution to the nonhomogeneous system
    <m>A\vx = \vb</m> can be written in the form <m>\vp + \vv_h</m>,
    where <m>\vp</m> is a particular solution to
    <m>A\vx = \vb</m> and <m>\vv_h</m> is a solution to the corresponding homogeneous 
    system <m>A\vx = \vzero</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    To understand why this <em>always</em> happens,
    we will verify the result algebraically for an arbitrary <m>A</m> and <m>\vb</m>.
    Assuming that <m>\vp</m> is a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous system
    <m>A\vx=\vb</m>, we need to show that:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          if <m>\vv</m> is an arbitrary solution to the nonhomogeneous system,
          then <m>\vv = \vp + \vv_h</m>,
          where <m>\vv_h</m> is some solution to the homogeneous system <m>A\vx = \vzero</m>, and
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          if <m>\vv_h</m> is an arbitrary solution to the homogeneous system,
          then <m>\vp + \vv_h</m> is a solution to the nonhomogeneous system.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    To verify the first condition,
    suppose that <m>\vv</m> is a solution to the nonhomogeneous system <m>A \vx = \vb</m>.
    Since we want <m>\vv=\vp+\vv_h</m>,
    we need to verify that <m>\vv-\vp</m> is a solution for the homogeneous system so that 
    we can assign <m>\vv_h=\vv-\vp</m>.
    Note that
    <me>
      A(\vv - \vp) = A\vv - A\vp = \vb - \vb = \vzero \,
    </me>,
    using the distributive property of matrix-vector product over vector addition.
    Hence <m>\vv</m> is of the form
    <m>\vp + \vv_h</m> with <m>\vv_h = \vzero</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    To verify the second condition,
    consider a vector of the form <m>\vp + \vv_h</m>,
    where <m>\vv_h</m> is a homogeneous solution.
    We have
    <me>
      A(\vp + \vv_h) = A\vp + A\vv_h = \vb + \vzero = \vb
    </me>,
    and so <m>\vp + \vv_h</m> is a solution to <m>A \vx = \vb</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our work above proves the following theorem.
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="thm_1_e_1">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose the equation <m>A\vx=\vb</m> is consistent for some <m>\vb</m> and 
        <m>\vp</m> is a solution.
        Then the solution set of <m>A\vx=\vb</m> consists of all vectors of the form
        <m>\vv=\vp+\vv_h</m> where <m>\vv_h</m> is a solution to <m>A\vx=\vzero</m>.
      </p>
