  <title>Project: Fourier Series and Musical Tones</title>
  <p>
    Joseph Fourier first studied trigonometric polynomials to understand the flow of heat in metallic plates and rods.
    The resulting series, called Fourier series,
    now have applications in a variety of areas including electrical engineering,
    vibration analysis, acoustics,
    optics, signal processing,
    image processing, geology, quantum mechanics, and many more.
    For our purposes, we will focus on synthesized music.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pure musical tones are periodic sine waves.
    Simple electronic circuits can be designed to generate alternating current.
    Alternating current is current that is periodic,
    and hence is described by a combination of <m>\sin(kx)</m> and
    <m>\cos(kx)</m> for integer values of <m>k</m>.
    To synthesize an instrument like a violin,
    we can project the instrument's tones onto trigonometric polynomials <mdash/> and then we can produce them electronically.
    As we will see,
    these projections are least squares approximations onto certain vector spaces.
    The website <url href="http://www.falstad.com/fourier/" visual="falstad.com/fourier/"/> provides a tool for hearing sounds digitally created by certain functions.
    For example,
    you can listen to the sound generated by a sawtooth function <m>f</m> of the form
    <me>
      f(x) = \begin{cases}x \amp \text{ if }  -\pi \lt  x \leq \pi, \\ f(x-2\pi),   \amp  \text{ if }  \pi \lt  x, \\ f(x+2\pi),   \amp  \text{ if }  x \leq -\pi. \end{cases}
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Try out some of the tones on this website
    (click on the Sound button to hear the tones).
    You can also alter the tones by clicking on any one of the white dots and moving it up or down. and play with the buttons.
    We will learn much about what this website does in this project.
  </p>
  <p>
  <idx><h>trigonometric polynomial</h></idx>
    Pure tones are periodic and so are modeled by trigonometric functions.
    In general, trigonometric polynomials can be used to produce good approximations to periodic phenomena.
    A <term>trigonometric polynomial</term> is an object of the form
    <md>
      <mrow>c_0 + c_1 \cos(x) + d_1\sin(x) \amp + c_2\cos(2x) + d_2\sin(2x) + \cdots</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp + c_n \cos(nx) + d_n \sin(nx) + \cdots</mrow>
    </md>,
    where the <m>c_i</m> and <m>d_j</m> are real constants.
    With judicious choices of these constants,
    we can approximate periodic and other behavior with trigonometric polynomials.
    The first step for us will be to understand the relationships between the summands of these trigonometric polynomials in the inner product space <m>C[-\pi, \pi]</m><fn>
    With suitable adjustments,
    we can work over any interval that is convenient,
    but for the sake of simplicity in this project,
    we will restrict ourselves to the interval <m>[-\pi, \pi]</m>.
    </fn> of continuous functions from
    <m>[\pi, \pi]</m> to <m>\R</m> with the inner product
    <men xml:id="eq_ip">
      \langle f,g \rangle = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x)g(x) \ dx
    </men>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our first order of business is to verify that <xref ref="eq_ip"/> is,
    in fact, an inner product.
  </p>

  <project xml:id="act_Fourier_inner_product">
    <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>C[a,b]</m> be the set of continuous real-valued functions on the interval <m>[a,b]</m>.
      In <xref ref="ex_6_c_Cab"></xref>
      in <xref ref="sec_inner_products"></xref>
      we are asked to show that <m>C[a,b]</m> is a vector space,
      while <xref ref="ex_6_c_inner_products"></xref>
      in <xref ref="sec_inner_products"></xref> asks us to show that
      <m>\langle f,g \rangle = \int_a^b f(x)g(x) \, dx</m> defines an inner product on <m>C[a,b]</m>.
      However, <xref ref="eq_ip"></xref>
      is slightly different than this inner product.
      Show that any positive scalar multiple of an inner product is an inner product,
      and conclude that <xref ref="eq_ip"/> defines an inner product on <m>C[-\pi,\pi]</m>.
      (We will see why we introduce the factor of <m>\frac{1}{\pi}</m> later.)
    </p>
    </statement>
  </project>

  <p>
    Now we return to our inner product space
    <m>C[-\pi,\pi]</m> with inner product <xref ref="eq_ip"/>.
    Given a function <m>g</m> in <m>C[-\pi,\pi]</m>,
    we approximate <m>g</m> using only a finite number of the terms in a trigonometric polynomial.
    Let <m>W_n</m> be the subspace of
    <m>C[-\pi,\pi]</m> spanned by the functions
    <me>
      1, \cos(x), \sin(x), \cos(2x), \sin(2x), \ldots, \cos(nx), \sin(nx)
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    One thing we need to know is the dimension of <m>W_n</m>.

    Once we have an orthogonal basis for <m>W_n</m>,

    Throughout the remainder of this project,

    Now we need to recall how to find the best approximation to a vector by a vector in a subspace,
    and apply that idea to approximate an arbitrary function <m>g</m> with a trigonometric polynomial in <m>W_n</m>.
    Recall that the best approximation of a function <m>g</m> in
    <m>C[-\pi,\pi]</m> is the projection of <m>g</m> onto <m>W_n</m>.
    If we have an orthonormal basis
    <m>\{h_0, h_1, h_2, \ldots,
    h_{2n}\}</m> of <m>W_n</m>, then the projection of <m>g</m> onto <m>W_n</m> is

    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    With this idea,
    we can find formulas for the coefficients when we project an arbitrary function onto <m>W_n</m>.

      This activity is not connected to the idea of musical tones,
