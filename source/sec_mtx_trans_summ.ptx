    In this section we determined how to represent any matrix transformation 
    from <m>\R^n</m> to <m>\R^m</m> as a matrix transformation,
    and what it means for a matrix transformation to be one-to-one and onto.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          A matrix transformation is a function <m>T: \R^n \to \R^m</m> defined by
          <m>T(\vx) = A\vx</m> for some <m>m \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A matrix transformation <m>T</m> from <m>\R^n</m> to <m>\R^m</m> satisfies
          <me>
            T(a\vu + b\vv) = aT(\vu) + bT(\vv)
          </me>
          for any scalars <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> and any vectors <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> 
          in <m>\R^n</m>.
          The fact that <m>T</m> preserves linear combinations is why we say that <m>T</m> 
          is a linear transformation.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          An <m>m \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> defines the matrix transformation <m>T</m> via
          <me>
            T(\vx) = A \vx
          </me>.
          The domain of this transformation is <m>\R^n</m> because the matrix-vector product 
          <m>A \vx</m> is only defined if <m>\vx</m> is an <m>n \times 1</m> vector.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If <m>A</m> is an <m>m \times n</m> matrix,
          then the codomain of the matrix transformation <m>T</m> defined by 
          <m>T(\vx) = A \vx</m> is <m>\R^m</m>.
          This is because the matrix-vector product <m>A \vx</m> with <m>\vx</m> an
          <m>n \times 1</m> vector is an <m>m \times 1</m> vector.
          The range of <m>T</m> is the subset of the codomain of <m>T</m> consisting of all 
          vectors of the form <m>T(\vx)</m> for vectors <m>\vx</m> in the domain of <m>T</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A matrix transformation <m>T</m> from <m>\R^n</m> to <m>\R^m</m> is <term>one-to-one</term>
          if each <m>\vb</m> in <m>\R^m</m> is the image of <em>at most</em>
          one <m>\vx</m> in <m>\R^n</m>.
          If <m>T</m> is a matrix transformation represented as <m>T(\vx) = A\vx</m>,
          then <m>T</m> is one-to-one if each column of <m>A</m> is a pivot column,
          or if the columns of <m>A</m> are linearly independent.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A matrix transformation <m>T</m> from <m>\R^n</m> to <m>\R^m</m> is <term>onto</term>
          if each <m>\vb</m> in <m>\R^m</m> is the image of <em>at least one</em>
          <m>\vx</m> in <m>\R^n</m>.
          If <m>T</m> is a matrix transformation represented as <m>T(\vx) = A\vx</m>,
          then <m>T</m> is onto if each row of <m>A</m> contains a pivot position,
          or if the span of the columns of <m>A</m> is all of <m>\R^m</m>.
        </p>
