  <title>Project: Shamir's Secret Sharing and Lagrange Polynomials</title>
  <p>
    Shamir's Secret Sharing is a secret sharing algorithm developed by the Israeli cryptographer Adi Shamir,
    who also contributed to the invention of RSA algorithm.
    The idea is to develop shares related to a secret code that can be distributed in such a way that the secret code can only be discovered if a fixed number of shareholders combine their information.
  </p>
  <p>
    The general algorithm for Shamir's Secret Sharing works by creating a polynomial with the secret code as one coefficient and random remaining coefficients.
    More specifically, to create a <m>(k,n)</m> threshold scheme,
    let <m>a_0</m> be the secret code.
    Then choose at random <m>k-1</m> positive integers <m>a_1</m>,
    <m>a_2</m>,
    <m>\ldots</m>, <m>a_{k-1}</m> and create the polynomial
    <me>
      p(t) = a_0 + a_1t + a_2 t^2 + \cdots + a_{k-1}t^{k-1}
    </me>,
    where <m>a_0</m> is the secret.
    Evaluate <m>p(t)</m> at <m>n</m> different inputs <m>t_1</m>,
    <m>t_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
    <m>t_n</m> to create <m>n</m> points <m>P_1 = (t_1,p(t_1))</m>,
    <m>P_2 = (t_2,p(t_2))</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
    <m>P_n = (t_n, p(t_n))</m>.
    Each participant is given one of these points.
    Since any collection of <m>k</m> distinct points on the graph of <m>p(t)</m> uniquely determines <m>p(t)</m>,
    any combination of <m>k</m> of the participants could reconstruct <m>p(t)</m>.
    The secret is then <m>p(0)</m>.
    (Note that, except under very restrictive circumstances,
    there is no polynomial of degree less than <m>k</m> that passes through the given <m>k</m> points,
    so it would be impossible for fewer than <m>k</m> participants to reconstruct the message.)
  </p>
  <p>
    As an example, let our secret code be <m>a_0=1234</m>.
    Let <m>n = 6</m> and <m>k = 3</m>.
    Choose two positive integers at random,
    say <m>a_1 = 100</m> and <m>a_2 = 38</m>.
    Then
    <men xml:id="eq_SSS_polynomial">
      p(t) = 1234 + 100t + 38t^2
    </men>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now we construct <m>6</m> points by selecting <m>6</m> positive integers,
    say <m>t_1 = 1</m>, <m>t_2 = 2</m>, <m>t_3 = 3</m>,
    <m>t_4 = 4</m>, <m>t_5 = 5</m>, and <m>t_6 = 6</m>.
    Evaluating <m>p(t)</m> at <m>t=1</m> through <m>t=6</m> gives us the points <m>P_1 = (1,1372)</m>,
    <m>P_2 = (2,1586)</m>, <m>P_3 = (3,1876)</m>,
    <m>P_4 = (4,2242)</m>, <m>P_5 = (5,2684)</m>,
    and <m>P_6 = (6,3202)</m>.
    Our goal is to find the polynomial that passes through any three of these points.
    The next activity will show us how to find this polynomial.

    <introduction>
    <p>
      It will be instructive to work in the most general setting.
      We restrict ourselves to the degree <m>2</m> case for now.
      Given three scalars <m>t_1</m>, <m>t_2</m>,
      and <m>t_3</m>, define <m>L: \pol_2 \to \R^3</m> by
      <me>
        L(q(t)) = \left[ \begin{array}{c} q(t_1) \\  q(t_2) \\ q(t_3) \end{array}  \right]

            Recall that the matrix <m>[L]_{\CS}^{\CB}</m> has the property that
            <m>[L(q(t))]_{\CB} = [L]_{\CS}^{\CB}[q(t)]_{\CS}</m> for any <m>q(t)</m> in <m>\pol_2</m>.
            So <m>L</m> is one-to-one if and only if the matrix transformation defined by <m>[L]_{\CS}^{\CB}</m> is one-to-one.
            Use this idea to show that <m>L</m> is one-to-one if and only if <m>t_1</m>,
            <m>t_2</m>,

            We proceed by finding quadratic polynomials <m>\ell_1(t)</m>,

            Explain why, if <m>\ell_1(t)</m>, <m>\ell_2(t)</m>,

    The Shamir Secret Sharing algorithm depends on being able to find a unique polynomial <m>p(t)</m> that passes through the created points.
