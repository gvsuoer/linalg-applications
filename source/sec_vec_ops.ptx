  <title>Vectors and Vector Operations</title>
  <p>
    As discussed in <xref ref="pa_1_d"></xref>,
    a vector is simply a list of numbers.
    We can add vectors of like size and multiply vectors by scalars.
    These operations define a structure on the set of all vectors with the same number of 
    components that will be our major object of study in linear algebra.
    Ultimately we will expand our idea of vectors to a more general context and study what we 
    will call <term>vector spaces</term>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In <xref ref="pa_1_d"></xref>
    we saw how to add vectors and multiply vectors by scalars in <m>\R^2</m>,
    and this idea extends to <m>\R^n</m> for any <m>n</m>.
    Before we do so,
    one thing we didn't address in <xref ref="pa_1_d"></xref>
    is what it means for two vectors to be equal.
    It should seem reasonable that two vectors are equal if and only if they have the same 
    corresponding components.
    More formally, if we let
    <me>
      \vu = \left[ \begin{array}{c} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ \vdots \\ u_n \end{array}  \right] \ \text{ and }  \ \vv = \left[ \begin{array}{c} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ \vdots \\ v_n \end{array}  \right]
    </me>
    be vectors in <m>\R^n</m>,
    then <m>\vu = \vv</m> if <m>u_i = v_i</m> for every <m>i</m> between 1 and <m>n</m>.
    Note that this statement implies that a vector in <m>\R^2</m> cannot equal a vector in 
    <m>\R^3</m> because they don't have the same number of components.
    With this in mind we can now define the sum
    <m>\vu + \vv</m> of the vectors <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> to be the vector in <m>\R^n</m> 
    defined by
    <me>
      \vu + \vv = \left[ \begin{array}{c} u_1+v_1 \\ u_2+v_2 \\ \vdots \\ u_n+v_n \end{array}  \right]
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In other words, to add two vectors of the same size,
    we add corresponding components.
  </p>
  <p>
    Similarly, we can define scalar multiplication of a vector.
    If <m>c</m> is a scalar,
    then the scalar multiple <m>c \vv</m> of the vector <m>\vv</m> is the vector in <m>\R^n</m> 
    defined by
    <me>
      c\vv = \left[ \begin{array}{c} cv_1 \\ cv_2 \\ \vdots \\ cv_n \end{array}  \right]
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In other words,
    the scalar multiple <m>c\vv</m> of the vector <m>\vv</m> is the vector obtained by 
    multiplying each component of the vector <m>\vv</m> by the scalar <m>c</m>.
    Since we can add vectors and multiply vectors by scalars,
    we can then add together scalar multiples of vectors.
    For completeness,
    we define vector subtraction as adding a scalar multiple:
    <me>
      \vv - \vu = \vv + (-1)\vu
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This definition is equivalent to defining subtraction of <m>\vu</m> from <m>\vv</m> by 
    subtracting components of <m>\vu</m> from the corresponding components of <m>\vv</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    After defining operations on objects,
    we should wonder what kinds of properties these operations have.
    For example,
    with the operation of addition of real numbers we know that <m>1+2</m> is equal to <m>2+1</m>.
    This is called the <em>commutative</em>
    property of scalar addition and says that order does not matter when we add real numbers.
    It is natural for us to ask if similar properties hold for the vector operations,
    addition and scalar multiplication, we defined.
    You showed in <xref ref="pa_1_d"></xref>
    that the addition operation is also commutative on vectors in <m>\R^2</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the activity below we consider how the two operations,
    addition and scalar multiplication, interact with each other.
    In real numbers,
    we know that multiplication is distributive over addition.
    Is that true with vectors as well?
  </p>

  <activity xml:id="act_A1_3_1">
    <statement>
    <p>
      We work with vectors in <m>\R^2</m> to make the notation easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>a</m> be an arbitrary scalar,
      and <m>\vu = \left[ \begin{array}{c} u_1\\ u_2 \end{array} \right]</m> and <m>\vv = \left[ \begin{array}{c} v_1\\ v_2 \end{array} \right]</m> be two
      <em>arbitrary</em> vectors in <m>\R^2</m>.
      Is <m>a(\vu + \vv)</m> equal to <m>a\vu + a\vv</m>?
      What property does this imply about the scalar multiplication and addition operations on vectors?
    </p>
    </statement>
  </activity>

  <p>
    Similar arguments can be used to show the following properties of vector addition and
    multiplication by scalars.

  <theorem xml:id="thm_vector_properties">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\vv</m>, <m>\vu</m>,
        and <m>\vw</m> be vectors in <m>\R^n</m> and let <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> be scalars.
        Then
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\vv + \vu = \vu + \vv</m>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>(\vv + \vu) + \vw = \vv + (\vu + \vw)</m>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The vector <m>\vz = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \end{array} \right]</m> 
              has the property that <m>\vv + \vz = \vv</m>.
              The vector <m>\vz</m> is called the <term>zero vector</term>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>(-1)\vv + \vv = \vz</m>.
              The vector <m>(-1)\vv = -\vv</m> is called the
              <term>additive inverse</term>
              of the vector <m>\vv</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>(a+b) \vv = a\vv + b\vv</m>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>a(\vv + \vu) = a\vv + a\vu</m>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>(ab) \vv = a(b\vv)</m>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>1 \vv = \vv</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    We will later see that the above properties make the set <m>\R^n</m> a <term>vector space</term>.
    These properties just say that, for the most part,
    we can manipulate vectors just as we do real numbers.
    Please note, though,
    that there is no multiplication or division of vectors.
