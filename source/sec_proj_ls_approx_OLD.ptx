  <title>Project: Other Least Squares Approximations</title>
  <p>
    In this section we learned how to fit a polynomial function to a set of data in the least squares sense.
    But data takes on many forms,
    so it is important to be able to fit other types of functions to data sets.
    We investigate three different types of regression problems in this project.

    <introduction>
    <p>
      The length of a species of fish is to be represented as a function of the age and water temperature as shown in the table on the next page.<fn>
      Data from <em>Mathematical Algorithms for Linear Regression</em>, Helmut Spaeth, Academic Press, 1991, page 305, ISBN 0-12-656460-4.
      </fn> The fish are kept in tanks at 25, 27, 29 and 31 degrees Celsius.
      After birth,
      a test specimen is chosen at random every 14 days and its length measured.
      The data include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>I</m>, the index;
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>x</m>, the age of the fish in days;
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>y</m>, the water temperature in degrees Celsius;
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>z</m>, the length of the fish.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Since there are three variables in the data,
      we cannot perform a simple linear regression.
      Instead, we seek a model of the form
      <me>
        f(x,y) = ax+by+c
      </me>
      to fit the data, where <m>f(x,y)</m> approximates the length.
      That is, we seek the best fit plane to the data.
      This is an example of what is called multiple linear regression.
      A scatterplot of the data, along with the best fit plane,
      is also shown.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            As we did when we fit polynomials to data,
            we start by considering what would happen if all of our data points satisfied our model function.
            In this case our data points have the form <m>(x_1,y_1,z_1)</m>,
            <m>(x_2,y_2,z_2)</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>(x_m,y_m,z_m)</m>.
            Explain what system of linear equations would result if the data points actually satisfy our model function <m>f(x,y)= ax+by+c</m>.
            (You don't need to write 44 different equations,
            just explain the general form of the system.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Write the system from (a) in the form <m>M \va = \vz</m>,
            and specifically identify the matrix <m>M</m> and the vectors <m>\va</m> and <m>\vz</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The same derivation as with the polynomial regression models shows that the vector <m>\va^*</m> that minimizes <m>||\vz - M\va||</m> is found by
            <me>
              \va^* = \left(M^{\tr}M\right)^{-1}M^{\tr}\vz
            </me>,
            Use this to find the least squares fit of the form <m>f(x,y) = ax+by+c</m> to the data.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Provide a numeric measure of how well this model function fits the data.
            Explain.

      Population growth is typically not well modeled by polynomial functions.
      Populations tend to grow at rates proportional to the population,
      which implies exponential growth.
      For example, <xref ref="T_7_d_US_population"></xref>
      shows the approximate population of the United States in years between 1920 and 2000,
      with the population measured in millions.

      If we assume the population grows exponentially,
      we would want to find the best fit function <m>f</m> of the form <m>f(t) = ae^{kt}</m>,
      where <m>a</m> and <m>k</m> are constants.
      However, an exponential function is not linear.
      So to apply the methods we have developed,
      we could instead apply the natural logarithm to both sides of
      <m>y = ae^{kt}</m> to obtain the equation <m>\ln(y) = \ln(a) + kt</m>.
      We can then find the best fit line to the data in the form
      <m>(t, \ln(y))</m> to determine the values of <m>\ln(a)</m> and <m>k</m>.
      Use this approach to find the best fit exponential function in the least squares sense to the U.S. population data.
      Then look up the U.S. population in 2010
      (include your source)
      and compare to the estimate given by your model function.
      If your prediction is not very close,
      give some plausible explanations for the difference.

      Carl Friedrich Gauss is often credited with inventing the method of least squares.
      He used the method to find a best-fit ellipse which allowed him to correctly predict the orbit of the asteroid Ceres as it passed behind the sun in 1801. (Adrien-Marie Legendre appears to be the first to publish the method,
      though.) Here we examine the problem of fitting an ellipse to data.

    <p>
      An ellipse is a quadratic equation that can be written in the form
      <men xml:id="eq_ellipse">
        x^2 + By^2 + Cxy + Dx + Ey + F = 0
      </men>
      for constants <m>B</m>, <m>C</m>,
      <m>D</m>, <m>E</m>, and <m>F</m>, with <m>B > 0</m>.
      We will find the best-fit ellipse in the least squares sense through the points
      <me>
        (0,2), \ (2,1), \ (1, -1), \ (-1, -2), \ (-3,1), \ \text{ and }  \ (-1, -1)
      </me>.
    </p>

            Find the least squares ellipse to this set of points.
            Make sure your method is clear. (Note that we are really fitting a surface of the form
            <m>f(x,y) = x^2 + By^2 + Cxy + Dx + Ey + F</m> to a set of data points in the <m>xy</m>-plane.
            So the error is the sum of the vertical distances from the points in the <m>xy</m>-plane to the surface.)
