  <title>Finding a Basis for a Vector Space</title>
  <p>
    We already know how to find bases for certain vector spaces,
    namely <m>\Nul A</m> and <m>\Col A</m>,
    where <m>A</m> is any matrix.
    Finding a basis for a different kind of vector space will require other methods.
    Since a basis for a vector space is a minimal spanning set,
    to find a basis for a given vector space we might begin from scratch,
    starting with a given vector in the space and adding one vector at a time until we have a spanning set.

      Let <m>W = \{a + bt + ct^3 \mid a, b, c \text{ are scalars } \}</m>.
      We will find a basis of <m>W</m> that contains the polynomial <m>3+t-t^3</m>.

            Explain why this means that the set <m>\CS_1</m> does not span <m>W</m>.

            Let <m>\CS_2 = \{3+t-t^3, p(t)\}</m>.
            Find a polynomial <m>q(t)</m> that is not in <m>\Span \ \CS_2</m>.
            What does this mean about <m>\CS_2</m> being a possible spanning set of <m>W</m>?

            Let <m>\CS_3 = \{3+t-t^3, p(t), q(t)\}</m>.

    Alternatively,
    we might construct a basis from a known spanning set.

    <xref ref="act_5_b_2">Activities</xref>
    and <xref ref="act_5_b_2_b"></xref>
    give us two ways of finding a basis for a subspace <m>W</m> of a vector space <m>V</m>,
    assuming <m>W</m> has a basis with finitely many vectors.
    One way (illustrated in <xref ref="act_5_b_2">Activity</xref>) is to start by choosing any non-zero vector <m>\vw_1</m> in <m>W</m>.
    Let <m>\CS_1 = \{\vw_1\}</m>.
    If <m>\CS_1</m> spans <m>W</m>,
    then <m>\CS_1</m> is a basis for <m>W</m>.
    If not, there is a vector <m>\vw_2</m> in <m>W</m> that is not in <m>\Span \ \CS_1</m>.
    Then <m>\CS_2 = \{\vw_1, \vw_2\}</m> is a linearly independent set.
    If <m>\Span \ \CS_2 = W</m>,
    then <m>\CS_2</m> is a basis for <m>W</m> and we are done.
    If not, repeat the process.
    We will show later that this process must stop as long as we know that <m>W</m> has a basis with finitely many vectors.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another way
    (illustrated in <xref ref="act_5_b_2_b">Activity</xref>)
    to find a basis for <m>W</m> is to start with a spanning set <m>\CS_1</m> of <m>W</m>.
    If <m>\CS_1</m> is linearly independent,
    then <m>\CS_1</m> is a basis for <m>W</m>.
    If <m>\CS_1</m> is linearly dependent,
    then one vector in <m>\CS_1</m> is a linear combination of the others and we can remove that vector to obtain a new set <m>\CS_2</m> that also spans <m>W</m>.
    If <m>\CS_2</m> is linearly independent,
    then <m>\CS_2</m> is a basis for <m>W</m>.
    If not, we repeat the process as many times as needed until we arrive until at a subset <m>\CS_k</m> of <m>\CS_1</m> that is linearly independent and spans <m>W</m>.
    We summarize these results in the following theorem.

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>W</m> be a subspace of a finite-dimensional vector space <m>V</m>.
        Then
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              any linearly independent subset of <m>W</m> can be extended to a basis of <m>W</m>,
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              any subset of <m>W</m> that spans <m>W</m> can be reduced to a basis of <m>W</m>.

  <p>
    We conclude this section with the result mentioned in the introduction <mdash/> that every vector in a vector space with basis <m>\B</m> can be written in one and only one way as a linear combination of basis vectors.
    The proof is similar to that of <xref ref="thm_1_f_unique_representation">Theorem</xref> and is left to the exercises.
