  <title>Onto and One-to-One Transformations</title>
  <p>
    The problems we have been asking about solutions to systems of linear equations can 
    be rephrased in terms of matrix transformations.
    The question about whether a system
    <m>A \vx = \vb</m> is consistent for any vector <m>\vb</m> is also a question about the 
    existence of a vector <m>\vx</m> so that <m>T(\vx) = \vb</m>,
    where <m>T</m> is the matrix transformation defined by <m>T(\vx) = A \vx</m>.

      Let <m>T</m> be the matrix transformation defined by <m>T(\vx) = A\vx</m> where <m>A</m> is

            The previous question can be rephrased as a matrix equation question.
            We are asking whether <m>A \vx = \vb</m> is consistent for every <m>\vb</m>.
            How is the answer to this question related to the pivots of <m>A</m>?
          </p>
        </statement>
      </task>
    
  </activity>

  <p>
    If <m>T</m> is a matrix transformation,
    <xref ref="act_1_g_4"></xref>
    illustrates that the range of a matrix transformation <m>T</m> may not equal its codomain.
    In other words,
    there may be vectors <m>\vb</m> in the codomain of <m>T</m> that are not the image of 
    any vector in the domain of <m>T</m>.
    If it is the case for a matrix transformation <m>T</m> that there is always a vector 
    <m>\vx</m> in the domain of <m>T</m> such that
    <m>T(\vx) = \vb</m> for any vector <m>\vb</m> in the codomain of <m>T</m>,
    then <m>T</m> is given a special name.
  </p>

    <statement>
      <p>
        A matrix transformation <m>T</m> from <m>\R^n</m> to <m>\R^m</m> is <term>onto</term>
        if each <m>\vb</m> in <m>\R^m</m> is the image of <term>at least one</term>
        <m>\vx</m> in <m>\R^n</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    So the matrix transformation <m>T</m> from <m>\R^n</m> to <m>\R^m</m> defined by
    <m>T(\vx) = A\vx</m> is onto if the equation
    <m>A \vx = \vb</m> has a solution for each vector <m>\vb</m> in <m>\R^m</m>.
    Since the vectors <m>A\vx</m> are linear combinations of the columns of <m>A</m>,
    <m>T</m> is onto exactly when the span of the columns of <m>A</m> is all of <m>\R^m</m>.
    <xref ref="act_1_g_4"></xref>
    shows us that <m>T</m> is onto if every row of <m>A</m> contains a pivot.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another question to ask about matrix transformations is how many vectors there 
    can be that map onto a given output vector.

            Assume more generally that for some vector <m>\vb</m>,
            there is a vector <m>\vx</m> so that <m>T(\vx) = \vb</m>.
            Write this as a matrix equation to determine how many solutions this equation has.
            Explain.
            How is the answer to this question related to the pivots of <m>A</m>?

  <p>
    The uniqueness of a solution to
    <m>A \vx = \vb</m> is the same as saying that the matrix transformation <m>T</m> defined by
    <m>T(\vx) = A\vx</m> maps exactly one vector to <m>\vb</m>.
    A matrix transformation <m>T</m> that has the property that every image vector is an 
    image in exactly one way is also a special type of transformation.
  </p>

  <definition>
    <idx><h>one-to-one</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A matrix transformation <m>T</m> from <m>\R^n</m> to <m>\R^m</m> is <term>one-to-one</term>
        if each <m>\vb</m> in <m>\R^m</m> is the image of <term>at most</term>
        one <m>\vx</m> in <m>\R^n</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    So the matrix transformation <m>T</m> from <m>\R^n</m> to <m>\R^m</m> defined by
    <m>T(\vx) = A\vx</m> is one-to-one if the equation
    <m>A \vx = \vb</m> has a unique solution whenever <m>A \vx = \vb</m> is consistent.
    Since the vectors <m>A\vx</m> are linear combinations of the columns of <m>A</m>,
    the unique solution requirement indicates that any output vector can be written in 
    exactly one way as a linear combination of the columns of <m>A</m>.
    This implies that the columns of <m>A</m> are linearly independent.
    <xref ref="act_1_g_5"></xref>
    indicates that this happens when every column of <m>A</m> is a pivot column.
  </p>
  <p>
    To summarize,
    if <m>T</m> is a matrix transformation defined by <m>T(\vx) = A \vx</m>,
    then <m>T</m> is onto if every row of <m>A</m> contains a pivot,
    and <m>T</m> is one-to-one if every column of <m>A</m> is a pivot column.
    It is important to note the difference:
    being one-to-one depends on the rows of <m>A</m> and being onto depends on the columns 
    of <m>A</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having a matrix transformation from <m>\R^n</m> to <m>\R^m</m> can tell us things 
    about <m>m</m> and <m>n</m>.
    For example,
    when a matrix transformation from <m>\R^n</m> to <m>\R^m</m> is one-to-one,
    it means that there is a unique input vector for every output vector.
    Since a matrix transformation preserves the algebraic structure of <m>\R^n</m>,
    this implies that the collection of the images of the vectors in the domain of 
    <m>T</m> form a copy of <m>\R^n</m> inside of <m>\R^m</m>.
    If we think of <m>T</m> as a one-to-one matrix transformation with
    <m>T(\vx) = A \vx</m> for some <m>m \times n</m> matrix,
    then every column of <m>A</m> will have to be a pivot column.
    It follows that if there is a one-to-one matrix transformation from <m>\R^n</m> to <m>\R^m</m>,
    we must have <m>m \geq n</m>.
    Similarly, if a matrix transformation <m>T</m> from <m>\R^n</m> to <m>\R^m</m> is onto,
    then for each <m>\vb</m> in <m>\R^m</m>,
    if we select one vector in the domain of <m>T</m> whose image is <m>\vb</m>,
    then the collection of these vectors in the domain of <m>T</m> is a copy of <m>\R^m</m> 
    inside of <m>\R^n</m>.
    So if there is an onto matrix transformation from <m>\R^n</m> to <m>\R^m</m>,
    then <m>n \geq m</m>.
    As a consequence,
    the only way a matrix transformation from <m>\R^n</m> to <m>\R^m</m> is both one-to-one 
    and onto is if <m>n = m</m>.
