  <title>Application: Balancing Chemical Reactions</title>
  <p>
    Linear systems have applications in chemistry when balancing chemical equations.
    When a chemical reaction occurs,
    molecules of different substances combine to create molecules of other substances.
    Chemists represent such reactions with chemical equations.
    To balance a chemical equation means to find the number of atoms of each element involved that 
    will preserve the number of atoms in the reaction.
    As an example, consider the chemical equation
    <men xml:id="eq_reaction1">
      \text{C} _2\text{H} _6 + \text{O} _2 \to \text{ CO } _2 + \text{H} _2\text{O}
    </men>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This equation asks about what will happen when the chemicals ethane 
    (<m>\text{C} _2\text{H} _6</m>) and oxygen (<m>\text{O} _2</m>),
    called the <term>reactants</term> of the reaction,
    combine to produce carbon dioxide (<m>\text{ CO } _2</m>) and water (<m>\text{H} _2\text{O}</m>),
    called the <term>products</term> of the reaction
    (note that oxygen gas is <term>diatomic</term>,
    so that oxygen atoms are paired).
    The arrow indicates that it is the reactants that combine to form the products.
    Any chemical reaction has to obey the Law of Conservation of Mass that says that mass can 
    neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction.
    Consequently,
    a chemical reaction requires the same number of atoms on both sides of the reaction.
    In other words,
    the total mass of the reactants must equal the total mass of the products.
    In reaction <xref ref="eq_reaction1"/> the chemicals involved are made up of carbon (C), 
    hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O) atoms.
    To balance the equation,
    we need to know how many molecules of each chemical are combined to preserve the number of 
    atoms of C, H, and O. This can be done by setting up a linear system of equations of the form

    where <m>x_1</m>, <m>x_2</m>, <m>x_3</m>,
    and <m>x_4</m> represent the number of molecules of <m>\text{C} _2\text{H} _6</m>,
    <m>\text{O} _2</m>, <m>\text{ CO } _2</m>,
    and <m>\text{H} _2\text{O}</m>,
    respectively, in the reaction and then solving the system.
