  <title>The Determinant of a Square Matrix</title>
  <p>
    Around 1900 or so determinants were deemed much more important than they are today.
    In fact, determinants were used even before matrices.
    According to Tucker<fn>
    Tucker, Alan. (1993).
    The Growing Importance of Linear Algebra in Undergraduate Mathematics.
    <pubtitle>The College Mathematics Journal</pubtitle>, 1, 3-9.
    </fn> determinants
    (not matrices)
    developed out of the study of coefficients of systems of linear equations and were used by Leibniz 150 years before the term matrix was coined by J. J. Sylvester in 1848.
    Even though determinants are not as important as they once were,
    the determinant of a matrix is still a useful quantity.
    We saw in <xref ref="pa_4_a"></xref>
    that the determinant of a matrix tells us if the matrix is invertible and how it can help us find eigenvalues.
    In this section,
    we will see how to find the determinant of any size matrix and how to use this determinant to find the eigenvalues.

  <p>
    The determinant of a <m>2 \times 2</m> matrix
    <m>A = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} a\amp b \\ c\amp d \end{array}  \right]</m> is <m>\det(A)=ad-bc</m>.
    The matrix <m>A</m> is invertible if and only if <m>\det(A) \neq 0</m>.
    We will use a recursive approach to find the determinants of larger size matrices building from the <m>2\times 2</m> determinants.
    We present the result in the
    <m>3 \times 3</m> case here <mdash/> a more detailed analysis can be found at the end of this section.
  </p>
  <p>
    To find the determinant of a
    <m>3 \times 3</m> matrix <m>A = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} a_{11}\amp a_{12}\amp a_{13} \\ a_{21}\amp a_{22}\amp a_{23}\\ a_{31}\amp a_{32}\amp a_{33} \end{array}  \right]</m>,
    we will use the determinants of three <m>2\times 2</m> matrices.
    More specifically, the determinant of <m>A</m>,
    denoted <m>\det(A)</m> is the quantity
    <men xml:id="eq_det_3by3">
      a_{11} \det\left(\left[ \begin{array}{cc} a_{22}\amp a_{23} \\ a_{32}\amp a_{33} \end{array}  \right] \right)- a_{12} \det \left(\left[ \begin{array}{cc} a_{21}\amp a_{23} \\ a_{31}\amp a_{33} \end{array}  \right] \right) + a_{13} \det \left(\left[ \begin{array}{cc} a_{21}\amp a_{22} \\ a_{31}\amp a_{32} \end{array}  \right] \right)
    </men>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This sum is called a <term>cofactor expansion</term>
    of the determinant of <m>A</m>.
    The smaller matrices in this expansion are obtained by deleting certain rows and columns of the matrix <m>A</m>.
    In general, when finding the determinant of an <m>n\times n</m> matrix,
    we find determinants of <m>(n-1)\times (n-1)</m> matrices,
    which we can again reduce to smaller matrices to calculate.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will use the specific matrix
    <me>
      A = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} 1 \amp  2 \amp  0 \\ 1 \amp  4 \amp  3 \\ 2 \amp  2 \amp  1 \end{array}  \right]
    </me>
    as an example in illustrating the cofactor expansion method in general.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          We first pick a row or column of <m>A</m>.
          We will pick the first row of <m>A</m> for this example.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          For each entry in the row
          (or column)
          we choose, in this case the first row,
          we will calculate the determinant of a smaller matrix obtained by removing the row and the column the entry is in.
          Let <m>A_{ij}</m> be the smaller matrix found by deleting the <m>i</m>th row and <m>j</m>th column of <m>A</m>.
          For entry <m>a_{11}</m>,
          we find the matrix <m>A_{11}</m> obtained by removing first row and first column:
          <me>
            A_{11} = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 4 \amp  3 \\ 2 \amp  1 \end{array}  \right]\,
          </me>.
          For entry <m>a_{12}</m>, we find
          <me>
            A_{12} = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 1 \amp  3 \\ 2 \amp  1 \end{array}  \right]\,
          </me>.
          Finally, for entry <m>a_{13}</m>, we find
          <me>
            A_{13} = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 1 \amp  4 \\ 2 \amp  2 \end{array}  \right] \,
          </me>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Notice that in the <m>3 \times 3</m> determinant formula in <xref ref="eq_det_3by3"/> above,
          the middle term had a (-) sign.
          The signs of the terms in the cofactor expansion alternate within each row and each column.
          More specifically,
          the sign of a term in the <m>i</m>th row and <m>j</m>th column is <m>(-1)^{i+j}</m>.
          We then obtain the following pattern of the signs within each row and column:
          <me>
            \left[ \begin{array}{cccc} + \amp  - \amp  + \amp  \cdots \\ - \amp  + \amp  - \amp  \cdots \\ + \amp  - \amp  + \amp  \cdots \\ \vdots \amp  \amp  \amp \end{array}  \right]
          </me>
          In particular,
          the sign factor for <m>a_{11}</m> is <m>(-1)^{1+1}=1</m>,
          for <m>a_{12}</m> is <m>(-1)^{1+2}=-1</m>,
          and for <m>a_{13}</m> is <m>(-1)^{1+3}=1</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          For each entry <m>a_{ij}</m> in the row
          (or column)
          of <m>A</m> we chose,
          we multiply the entry <m>a_{ij}</m> by the determinant of <m>A_{ij}</m> and the sign <m>(-1)^{i+j}</m>.
          In this case, we obtain the following numbers
          <me>
            a_{11} (-1)^{1+1} \det(A_{11})  = 1 \det \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 4 \amp  3 \\ 2 \amp  1 \end{array}  \right] = 1(4-6)=-2
          </me>
          <me>
            a_{12} (-1)^{1+2} \det(A_{12}) = -2 \det \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 1 \amp  3 \\ 2 \amp  1 \end{array}  \right] = -2(1-6)=10
          </me>
          <me>
            a_{13} (-1)^{1+3} \det(A_{13}) = 0
          </me>
          Note that in the last calculation,
          since <m>a_{13}=0</m>, we did not have to evaluate the rest of the terms.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Finally, we find the determinant by adding all these values:
          <md>
            <mrow>\det(A) \amp = a_{11} (-1)^{1+1} \det(A_{11}) + a_{12} (-1)^{1+2} \det(A_{12})</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp \qquad + a_{13} (-1)^{1+3} \det(A_{13})</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 8</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
