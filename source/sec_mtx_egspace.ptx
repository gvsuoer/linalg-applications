  <title>Eigenspaces of Matrix</title>
  <p>
    Recall that the eigenvectors of an
    <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> satisfy the equation
    <me>
      A \vx = \lambda \vx
    </me>
    for some scalar <m>\lambda</m>.
    Equivalently,
    the eigenvectors of <m>A</m> with eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m> satisfy the equation
    <me>
      (A - \lambda I_n) \vx = \vzero
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In other words,
    the eigenvectors for <m>A</m> with eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m> are the non-zero vectors in <m>\Nul A-\lambda I_n</m>.
    Recall that the null space of an
    <m>n \times n</m> matrix is a subspace of <m>\R^n</m>.
    In Preview <xref ref="pa_3_c_1">Activity</xref>
    we say how these subspaces provided a convenient coordinate system through which to view a matrix transformation.
    These special null spaces are called <em>eigenspaces</em>.

    If we know an eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m> of an <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m>,
    <xref ref="act_3_c_1">Activity</xref>
    shows us how to find a basis for the corresponding eigenspace <mdash/> just row reduce
    <m>A - \lambda I_n</m> to find a basis for <m>\Nul A-\lambda I_n</m>.
    To this point we have always been given eigenvalues for our matrices,
    and have not seen how to find these eigenvalues.
    That process will come a bit later.
    For now, we just want to become more familiar with eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
    The next activity should help connect eigenvalues to ideas we have discussed earlier.
