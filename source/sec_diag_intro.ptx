    As we have seen when studying Markov processes,
    each state is dependent on the previous state.
    If <m>\vx_0</m> is the initial state and <m>A</m> is the transition matrix,
    then the <m>n</m>th state is found by <m>A^n \vx_0</m>.
    In these situations, and others,
    it is valuable to be able to quickly and easily calculate powers of a matrix.
    We explore a way to do that in this section.

    <introduction>
    <p>
      Consider a very simplified weather forecast.
      Let us assume there are two possible states for the weather:
      rainy (<m>R</m>) or sunny(<m>S</m>).
      Let us also assume that the weather patterns are stable enough that we can reasonably predict the weather tomorrow based on the weather today.
      If is is sunny today,
      then there is a 70% chance that it will be sunny tomorrow,
      and if it is rainy today then there is a 40% chance that it will be rainy tomorrow.
      If <m>\vx_0 = \left[ \begin{array}{c} s \\ r \end{array}  \right]</m> is a state vector that indicates a probability <m>s</m> that it is sunny and probability <m>r</m> that it is rainy on day <m>0</m>, then
      <me>
        \vx_1 = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 0.70\amp 0.40 \\ 0.30\amp 0.60 \end{array}  \right] \vx_0
      </me>
      tells us the likelihood of it being sunny or rainy on day 1.
      Let <m>A = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 0.70\amp 0.40 \\ 0.30\amp 0.60 \end{array}  \right]</m>.

            Suppose it is sunny today,
            that is <m>\vx_0 = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 0 \end{array} \right]</m>.
            Calculate <m>\vx_1 = A \vx_0</m> and explain how this matrix-vector product tells us the probability that it will be sunny tomorrow.

            The previous result demonstrates that to determine the long-term probability of a sunny or rainy day,
            we want to be able to easily calculate powers of the matrix <m>A</m>.
            Use a computer algebra system (e.g., Maple, Mathematica, Wolfram<m>|</m>Alpha) to calculate the entries of <m>\vx_{10}</m>,
            <m>\vx_{20}</m>, and <m>\vx_{30}</m>.
            Based on this data,
            what do you expect the long term probability of any day being a sunny one?
