  <title>Project: The GGH Cryptosystem</title>
  <p>
    A cryptographic system
    (or cryptosystem)
    allows for secure communication between two or more parties.
    These systems take messages
    (called <term>plaintext</term>)
    and encrypt them in some way to produce what is called <term>ciphertext</term>.
    This is the scrambled information that is transmitted to the receiver,
    from which it should not be possible for someone who does not have the proper key to recover the original message.
    When the message is received by the intended recipient,
    it must be unscrambled or <term>decrypted</term>.
    Decryption is the process of converting ciphertext back to plaintext.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Goldreich-Goldwasser-Halevi (GGH) public key cryptosystem<fn>
    Published in 1997 by Oded Goldreich, Shafi Goldwasser,
    and Shai Halevi.
    </fn> uses lattices to encrypt plaintext.
    The security of the system depends on the fact that the Closest Vector Problem (CVP) is,
    in general, a very hard problem.
    To begin to understand these cryptosystems, we begin with lattices.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lattices are closely related to spans of sets of vectors in <m>\R^n</m>.
    If we start with a linearly independent set <m>S = \{\vb_1, \vb_2, \ldots, \vb_m\}</m> in <m>\R^n</m>,
    we can create the span of <m>S</m> <mdash/> the set of all linear combinations
    <me>
      c_1 \vb_1 + c_2 \vb_2 + \cdots + c_m \vb_m
    </me>,
    where <m>c_1</m>, <m>c_2</m>,
    <m>\ldots</m>, <m>c_m</m> are real numbers.
    This span creates a subspace of <m>\R^n</m>.
    If we restrict the set from which we choose the coefficients,
    we can create different types of structures.
    An important one is a lattice.
    The <em>lattice</em> <m>\mathcal{L}(S)</m> defined by the linearly independent set
    <m>S = \{\vb_1, \vb_2, \ldots, \vb_m\}</m> is the set of linear combinations
    <me>
      c_1 \vb_1 + c_2 \vb_2 + \cdots + c_m \vb_m
    </me>,
    where <m>c_1</m>, <m>c_2</m>,
    <m>\ldots</m>, <m>c_m</m> are integers.
    If the vectors in <m>S</m> have integer components,
    then every point in <m>\mathcal{L}(S)</m> will have integer entries.
    In these cases, <m>\mathcal{L}(S)</m> is a subset of <m>\Z^n</m>,
    as illustrated in <xref ref="F_Lattice_2"></xref>.
    Also, if <m>m = n</m> we say that the lattice
    <m>\mathcal{L}(S)</m> is <term>full-rank</term>.
    We will restrict ourselves to full-rank lattices in this project.
    A <term>basis</term> for a lattice is any set of linearly independent vectors that generates the lattice.
    There is a little special notation that is often used with lattices.
    If <m>\CB =  \{\vb_1, \vb_2, \ldots, \vb_n\}</m> is a basis for <m>\R^n</m>,
    we associate to <m>\CB</m> the matrix <m>B = [\vb_1 \ \vb_2 \ \vb_3 \ \cdots \ \vb_n]</m>.
    We then use the notation <m>\mathcal{L}(B)</m> to also refer to the lattice defined by <m>\CB</m>.

    <xref ref="act_lattices_1"></xref>
    shows that even if <m>\CB</m> is a basis for <m>\R^n</m>,
    it does not follow that <m>\mathcal{L}(\CB)</m> is all of <m>\Z^n</m>.
    So latices can be complicated,
    and problems in lattice theory can be very difficult.
  </p>
  <p>
    The GGH cryptosystem relies on the fact that we can convert
    <q>good</q>
    bases for lattices into
    <q>bad</q>
    bases.
    We will not delve into the details of what separates a
    <q>good</q>
    basis from a
    <q>bad</q>
    one, but suffice it to say that a good basis is one in which the basis vectors are close to being perpendicular<fn>
    This is also a good property in vector spaces.
    We will see in a later section that perpendicular basis vectors make calculations in vector spaces relatively easy.
    A similar thing is true in lattices,
    where we are able to solve certain variants of closest vector problem very efficiently.
    </fn> and are all short
    (that is, they have small norms),
    while any other basis is a bad basis.
    An example of a good basis is the basis <m>S_1</m> for <m>\R^2</m> in <xref ref="act_lattices_1"></xref>,
    and we will see later that
    <m>\{[-2 \ 8]^{\tr}, [-1 \ 3]^{\tr}\}</m> is a bad basis for the same lattice.
    You should draw a picture of the vectors <m>[-2 \ 8]^{\tr}</m> and
    <m>[-1 \ 3]^{\tr}</m> to convince yourself that this is a bad basis for its lattice.
  </p>
  <p>
    The GGH cryptosystem works with two <term>keys</term>
    <mdash/> a public key and a private key.
    The keys are based on lattices.
    The general process of the GGH cryptosystem is as follows.
    Begin with a good basis <m>\CB = \{\vb_1 \ \vb_2 \ \ldots \ \vb_n\}</m> of <m>\R^n</m> of vectors with integer components.
    Let <m>B = [\vb_1 \ \vb_2 \ \cdots \ \vb_n]</m> be the matrix associated with <m>\CB</m>.
    Let <m>\CB' = \{\vb'_1, \vb'_2, \ldots, \vb'_n\}</m> be a bad basis for which <m>\mathcal{L}(\CB') = \mathcal{L}(\CB)</m>.
    Let <m>B' = [\vb'_1 \ \vb'_2 \ \cdots \ \vb'_n]</m> be the matrix associated to the basis <m>\CB'</m>.
    The bad basis can be shared with anyone
    (the public key),
    but the good basis is kept secret
    (the private key).
    Start with a message <m>\vm = [m_1 \ m_2 \ \cdots \ m_n]^{\tr}</m> with integer entries to send.
  </p>
  <p>
    First we encrypt the message,
    which can be done by anyone who has the public key <m>\CB'</m>.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Create the message vector
          <me>
            \vm' = m_1 \vb'_1 +  m_2 \vb'_2 + \cdots +  m_n \vb'_n = B' \vm
          </me>
          that is in the lattice using the bad basis <m>\CB'</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Choose a small error <m>\ve</m> to add to <m>\vm'</m> to move <m>\vm'</m> off the lattice
          (small enough so that <m>\vm'</m> does not pass by another lattice point).
          This is an important step that will make the message difficult to decrypt without the key.
          Let <m>\vc = \vm' + \ve = B'\vm + \ve</m>.
          The vector <m>\vc</m> is the ciphertext that is to be transmitted to the receiver.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Only someone who knows the basis <m>\CB</m> can decode the ciphertext.
    This is done as follows.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Find the vector <m>\va = a_1 \vb_1 + a_2 \vb_2 + \cdots + a_n \vb_n</m> in the good basis <m>\CB</m> that is closest to <m>\vc</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          We interpret the vector <m>[a_1 \ a_2 \ \ldots \ a_n]^{\tr}</m> as being the encoded vector without the error.
          So to recreate the original message vector we need to undo the encrypting using the bad basis <m>\CB'</m>.
          That is, we need to find the weights <m>y_1</m>, <m>y_2</m>,
          <m>\ldots</m>, <m>y_n</m> such that
          <me>
            [a_1 \ a_2 \ \ldots \ a_n]^{\tr} = y_1 \vb'_1 + y_2 \vb'_2 + \cdots + y_n \vb'_n = B' [y_1 \ y_2 \ \cdots \ y_n]^{\tr}
          </me>.
          We can do this by as <m>[y_1 \ y_2 \ \cdots \ y_n]^{\tr} = B'^{-1} [a_1 \ a_2 \ \ldots \ a_n]^{\tr}</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    There are several items to address before we can implement this algorithm.
    One is how we create a bad basis <m>\CB'</m> from <m>\CB</m> that produces the same lattice.
    Another is how we find the vector in
    <m>\mathcal{\CB}</m> closest to a given vector.
    The latter problem is called the Closest Vector Problem (CVP) and is,
    in general, a very difficult problem.
    This is what makes lattice-based cryptosystems secure.
    We address the first of these items in the next activity,
    and the second a bit later.

            Show that this triangle is a right triangle,
            and conclude that the vectors <m>\vv_1 = [1 \ 1]^{\tr}</m>,

            Let <m>S_3</m> be the set whose vectors are the columns of the matrix <m>B_1U</m>.
            Show that <m>\mathcal{L}(S_1) = \mathcal{L}(S_3)</m>.

  <p>
    The two bases <m>S_1 = \{[1 \ 1]^{\tr}, [-1 \ 1]^{\tr}\}</m> and
    <m>S_3 =\{[-2 \ 8]^{\tr}, [-1 \ 3]^{\tr}\}</m> from <xref ref="act_lattices_2"></xref>
    are shown in <xref ref="F_Lattice_3"></xref>.
    This figure illustrates how the matrix <m>U</m> transforms the basis <m>S_1</m>,
    in which the vectors are perpendicular and short,
    to one in which the vectors are nearly parallel and significantly longer.
    So the matrix <m>U</m> converts the
    <q>good</q>
    basis <m>S_1</m> into a
    <q>bad</q>
    basis <m>S_2</m>, keeping the lattice intact.
    This is a key idea in the GGH cryptosystem.
    What makes this work is the fact that both <m>U</m> and <m>U^{-1}</m> have integer entries.
    The reason for this is that,
    for a <m>2 \times 2</m> matrix <m>U = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} a\amp b\\c\amp d \end{array} \right]</m>,
    we know that <m>U^{-1} = \frac{1}{ad-bc} \left[ \begin{array}{rr} d\amp -b\\-c\amp a \end{array} \right]</m>.
    If <m>U</m> has integer entries and <m>ad-bc = \pm 1</m>,
    then <m>U^{-1}</m> will also have integer entries.
    The number <m>ad-bc</m> is called the
    <em>determinant</em> of <m>U</m>,
    and matrices with determinant of <m>1</m> or <m>-1</m> are called <em>unimodular</em>.
    That what happened in <xref ref="act_lattices_2"></xref>
    happens in the general case is the focus of the next activity.

      Let <m>\CB = \{\vb_1, \vb_2\}</m> and
      <m>\CB' = \{\vb'_1, \vb'_2\}</m> be bases for <m>\R^2</m> with integer entries,
      and let <m>B = [\vb_1 \ \vb_2]</m> and
      <m>B' = [\vb'_1 \ \vb'_2]</m> be the matrices associated to these bases.
      Show that if <m>B' = BU</m> for some unimodular matrix <m>U</m> with integer entries,
      then <m>\mathcal{L}(B) = \mathcal{L}(B')</m>.

  <p>
    <xref ref="act_lattices_3"></xref>
    is the part we need for our lattice-based cryptosysystem.
    Although we won't show it here,
    the converse of the statement in <xref ref="act_lattices_3"></xref> is also true.
    That is, if <m>\CB</m> and <m>\CB'</m> generate the same lattice,
    then <m>B' = BU</m> for some unimodular matrix <m>U</m> with integer entries.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is one more item to address before we implement the GGH cryptosystem.
    That item is how to solve the Closest Vector Problem.
    There are some algorithms for approximating the closest vector in a basis.
    One is Babai's Closest Vector algorithm.
    This algorithm works in the following way.
    Consider a lattice with basis <m>\{\vb_1, \vb_2, \ldots, \vb_n\}</m>.
    To approximate the closest vector in the lattice to a vector <m>\vw</m>,
    find the weights <m>c_1</m>, <m>c_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
    <m>c_n</m> in <m>\R</m> such that <m>\vw = c_1\vb_1 + c_2 \vb_2 + \cdots + c_n \vb_n</m>.
    Then round the coefficients to the nearest integer.
    This algorithm works well for a good basis,
    but is unlikely to return a lattice point that is close to <m>\vw</m> if the basis is a bad one.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now we put this all together to illustrate the GGH algorithm.
