  <title>A Connection between <m>\Ker(T)</m> and a Matrix Representation of <m>T</m></title>
  <p>
    Recall that we defined the kernel of a matrix transformation
    <m>T: \R^n \to \R^m</m> to be the set of vectors that <m>T</m> maps to the zero vector.
    If <m>T</m> is the matrix transformation defined by <m>T(\vx) = A \vx</m>,
    we also saw that the kernel of <m>T</m> is the same as the null space of <m>A</m>.
    We can make a similar connection between a linear transformation and a matrix that defines the transformation.

    shows that if <m>T: V \to W</m> is a linear transformation from an <m>n</m>-dimensional vector space <m>V</m> with basis <m>\CB</m> to an <m>m</m>-dimensional vector space <m>W</m> with basis <m>\CC</m>,
    then there is a one-to-one correspondence between vectors in <m>\Ker(T)</m> and vectors in <m>\Nul [T]_{\CB}^{\CC}</m>.
    Recall that <m>T</m> is one-to-one if and only if <m>\Ker(T) = \{\vzero_V\}</m>,
    where <m>\vzero_V</m> is the additive identity of <m>V</m>.
    So <m>T</m> will be one-to-one if and only if <m>\Nul [T]_{\CB}^{\CC} = \{\vzero\}</m>.
    In other words,
    <m>T</m> is one-to-one if and only if every column of <m>\Nul [T]_{\CB}^{\CC}</m> is a pivot column.
    Note that this does not depend on the basis <m>\CB</m> and <m>\CC</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    A similar argument shows that <m>T</m> is onto if and only if every row of <m>[T]_{\CB}^{\CC}</m> contains a pivot.
    This is left to the exercises
    (see <xref ref="ex_8_b_range_matrix"></xref>).
