  <title>Application: The Bailey Model of an Epidemic</title>
  <p>
    The COVID-19 epidemic has generated many mathematical and statistical models to try to understand the spread of the virus.
    In 1950 Norman Bailey proposed a simple stochastic model of the spread of an epidemic.
    The solution to the model involves matrix exponentials and the Jordan canonical form is a useful tool for calculating matrix exponentials.
