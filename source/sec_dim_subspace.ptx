  <title>The Dimension of a Subspace</title>
  <p>
    Every subspace of a finite-dimensional vector space is a vector space,
    and since a subspace is contained in a vector space it is natural to think that the dimension of a subspace should be less than or equal to the dimension of the larger vector space.
    We verify that fact in this section.

    <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>V</m> be a finite dimensional vector space of dimension <m>n</m> and let <m>W</m> be a subspace of <m>V</m>.
      Explain why <m>W</m> cannot have dimension larger than <m>\dim(V)</m>,
      and if <m>W \neq V</m> then <m>\dim(W) \lt \dim(V)</m>.
