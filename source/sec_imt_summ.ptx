        Two statements are equivalent if,
        whenever one of the statements is true,
        then the other must also be true.

        To efficiently prove that a string of statements are all equivalent,
        we can prove that each statement in the list implies the next statement,
        and that the last statement implies the first.

        The Invertible Matrix Theorem gives us many conditions that are equivalent to an
        <m>n \times n</m> matrix being invertible.
        This theorem is important because it connects many of the concepts we have been studying.
