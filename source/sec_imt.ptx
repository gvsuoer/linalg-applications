  <title>The Invertible Matrix Theorem</title>
  <p>
    We have been introduced to many statements about existence and uniqueness of solutions to systems of linear equations,
    linear independence of columns of coefficient matrices,
    onto linear transformations, and many other items.
    In this section we will analyze these statements in light of how they are related to invertible matrices,
    with the main goal to understand the Invertible Matrix Theorem.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recall that an <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> is invertible if there is an
    <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>B</m> such that <m>AB = BA = I_n</m>,
    where <m>I_n</m> is the <m>n \times n</m> identity matrix.
    The Invertible Matrix Theorem is an important theorem in that it provides us with a wealth of statements that are all equivalent to the statement that an
    <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> is invertible,
    and connects many of the topics we have been discussing so far this semester into one big picture.

  <p>
    The Invertible Matrix Theorem is a theorem that provides many different statements that are equivalent to a matrix being invertible.
    As discussed in <xref ref="pa_2_d"></xref>,
    two statements are said to be <term>equivalent</term> if,
    whenever one of the statements is true,
    then the other is also true.
    So to demonstrate, say,
    statements I and II are equivalent, we need to argue that
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          if statement I is true, then so is statement II, and
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          if statement II is true then so is statement I.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    The Invertible Matrix Theorem, however,
    provides a long list of statements that are equivalent.
    It would be inefficient to prove,
    one by one, that each pair of statements is equivalent.
    (There are <m>\binom{14}{2} = 91</m> such pairs.)
    Fortunately, there is a shorter method that we can use.

      In this activity,
      we will consider certain parts of the Invertible Matrix Theorem and show that one implies another in a specific order.

            Consider the following implication:

            The symbol <m>\implies</m> is the implication symbol,
            so <m>(1) \implies (12)</m> is read to mean that statement <m>(1)</m> of the theorem implies statement <m>(12)</m>.
            </fn>  If the equation
            <m>A \vx = \vzero</m> has only the trivial solution,
            then the columns of <m>A</m> are linearly independent.
            This shows that part 2 of the IMT implies part 6 of the IMT. Justify this implication as if it is a T/F problem.

  <p>
    Using a similar ordering of circular implications as in <xref ref="act_2_d_1"></xref>,
    we can prove the Invertible Matrix Theorem by showing that each statement in the list implies the next statement,
    and that the last statement implies the first.

        <title>Statement (3) implies Statement (4)</title>
        <p>
          Suppose that every column of <m>A</m> is a pivot column.
          The fact that <m>A</m> is square means that every row of <m>A</m> contains a pivot,
          and hence the columns of <m>A</m> span <m>\R^n</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>Statement (4) implies Statement (5)</title>
        <p>
          Since the columns of <m>A</m> span <m>\R^n</m>,
          it must be the case that every row of <m>A</m> contains a pivot.
          This means that <m>A</m> must be row equivalent to <m>I_n</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>Statement (5) implies Statement (6)</title>
        <p>
          If <m>A</m> is row equivalent to <m>I_n</m>,
          there must be a pivot in every column,
          which means that the columns of <m>A</m> are linearly independent.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>Statement (6) implies Statement (7)</title>
        <p>
          If the columns of <m>A</m> are linearly independent,
          then there is a pivot in every column.
          Since <m>A</m> is a square matrix,
          there is a pivot in every row as well.
          So the columns of <m>A</m> span <m>\R^n</m>.
          Since they are also linearly independent,
          the columns form a minimal spanning set,
          which is a basis of <m>\R^n</m>.

      </li>
      <li>
        <title>Statement (7) implies Statement (8)</title>
        <p>
          If the columns form a basis of <m>\R^n</m>,
          then the columns are linearly independent.
          This means that each column is a pivot column,
          which also implies <m>A\vx=\vzero</m> has a unique solution and that <m>T</m> is one-to-one.

      </li>
      <li>
        <title>Statement (8) implies Statement (9)</title>
        <p>
          If <m>T</m> is one-to-one, then <m>A</m> has a pivot in every column.
          Since <m>A</m> is square, every row of <m>A</m> contains a pivot.
          Therefore, the system <m>A \vx = \vb</m> is consistent for every
          <m>\vb \in \R^n</m> and has a unique solution.

      <li>
        <title>Statement (9) implies Statement (10)</title>
        <p>
          If <m>A\vx=\vb</m> has a unique solution for every <m>\vb</m>,
          then the transformation <m>T</m> is onto since
          <m>T(\vx)=\vb</m> has a solution for every <m>\vb</m>.

        <p>
          Assume that <m>T</m> defined by <m>T(\vx) = A\vx</m> is onto.
          For each <m>i</m>, let <m>\ve_i</m> be the <m>i</m>th column of the
          <m>n \times n</m> identity matrix <m>I_n</m>.
          That is, <m>\ve_i</m> is the vector in <m>\R^n</m> with 1 in the <m>i</m>th component and 0 everywhere else.
          Since <m>T</m> is onto,
          for each <m>i</m> there is a vector <m>\vc_i</m> such that <m>T(\vc_i) = A \vc_i = \ve_i</m>.
          Let <m>C = [\vc_1  \ \vc_2 \ \cdots \ \vc_n]</m>.
          Then
          <me>
            AC = A[\vc_1  \ \vc_2 \ \cdots \ \vc_n] = [A\vc_1 \ A\vc_2 \ \cdots \ A\vc_n] = [\ve_1 \ \ve_2 \ \cdots \ \ve_n] = I_n
          </me>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>Statement (11) implies Statement (12)</title>
        <p>
          Assume <m>C</m> is an <m>n \times n</m> matrix so that <m>AC = I_n</m>.
          First we show that the matrix equation
          <m>C \vx = \vzero</m> has only the trivial solution.
          Suppose <m>C \vx = \vzero</m>.
          Then multiplying both sides on the left by <m>A</m> gives us
          <me>
            A(C \vx) = A \vzero
          </me>.
          Simplifying this equation using <m>AC=I_n</m>,
          we find <m>\vx = \vzero</m>.
          Since <m>C \vx = \vzero</m> has only the trivial solution,
          every column of <m>C</m> must be a pivot column.
          Since <m>C</m> is an <m>n \times n</m> matrix,
          it follows that every row of <m>C</m> contains a pivot position.
          Thus, the matrix equation <m>C \vx = \vb</m> is consistent and has a unique solution for every <m>\vb</m> in <m>\R^n</m>.
          Let <m>\vv_i</m> be the vector in <m>\R^n</m> satisfying
          <m>C \vv_i = \ve_i</m> for each <m>i</m> between 1 and <m>n</m> and let <m>M = [\vv_1 \ \vv_2 \ \cdots \ \vv_n]</m>.
          Then <m>CM = I_n</m>.
          Now we show that <m>CA = I_n</m>.
          Since
          <me>
            AC = I_n
          </me>
          we can multiply both sides on the left by <m>C</m> to see that
          <me>
            C(AC) = CI_n
          </me>.
          Now we multiply both sides on the right by <m>M</m> and obtain
          <me>
            (C(AC))M = CM
          </me>.
          Using the associative property of matrix multiplication and the fact that <m>CM = I_n</m> shows that
          <md>
            <mrow>(CA)(CM) \amp = CM</mrow>
            <mrow>CA = I_n</mrow>
          </md>.
          Thus, if <m>A</m> and <m>C</m> are <m>n \times n</m> matrices and
          <m>AC = I_n</m>, then <m>CA = I_n</m>.
          So we have proved our implication with <m>D = C</m>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>Statement (12) implies Statement (13)</title>
        <p>
          Assume that there is an <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>D</m> so that <m>DA = I_n</m>.
          Suppose <m>A \vx = \vzero</m>.
          Then multiplying both sides by <m>A</m> on the left, we find that
          <md>
            <mrow>D(A\vx) \amp = D\vzero</mrow>
            <mrow>(DA) \vx \amp = \vzero</mrow>
            <mrow>\vx \amp = \vzero</mrow>
          </md>.
          So the equation <m>A \vx = \vzero</m> has only the trivial solution and <m>0</m> is not an eigenvalue for <m>A</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>Statement (13) implies Statement (14)</title>
        <p>
          If 0 is not an eigenvalue of <m>A</m>,
          then the equation <m>A \vx = \vzero</m> has only the trivial solution.
          Since <xref ref="item_trivial_soln">statement</xref>
          implies <xref ref="item_AC_I">statement</xref>,
          there is an <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>C</m> such that <m>AC = I_n</m>.
          The proof that <xref ref="item_AC_I">statement</xref>
          implies <xref ref="item_DA_I">statement</xref>
          shows that <m>CA = I_n</m> as well.
          So <m>A</m> is invertible.
          By taking the transpose of both sides of the equation
          <m>AA^{-1}=A^{-1}A=I_n</m> (remembering <m>(AB)^{\tr}= B^{\tr}A^{\tr}</m>) we find
          <me>
            (A^{-1})^{\tr} A^{\tr} = A^{\tr} (A^{-1})^{\tr} = I_n^{\tr}=I_n \,
          </me>.
          Therefore, <m>(A^{-1})^{\tr}</m> is the inverse of <m>A^{\tr}</m> by definition of the inverse.

      </li>
      <li>
        <title>Statement (14) implies Statement (1)</title>
        <p>
          Since statement (1) implies statement (14),
          we proved <sq>If <m>A</m> is invertible,
          then <m>A^{\tr}</m> is invertible.</sq>' Using this implication with <m>A^{\tr}</m> replaced by <m>A</m>,
          we find that <sq>If <m>A^{\tr}</m> is invertible,
          then <m>(A^{\tr})^{\tr}</m> is invertible.</sq>' But <m>(A^{\tr})^{\tr}=A</m>,
          which proves that statement (14) implies statement (1).
        </p>

    This concludes our proof of the Invertible Matrix Theorem.
