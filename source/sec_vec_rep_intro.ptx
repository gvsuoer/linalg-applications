    So far we learned of a convenient method to represent a linear system using matrices.
    We now consider another representation of a linear system using <term>vectors</term>.
    Vectors can represent concepts in the physical world like velocity,
    acceleration,
    and force <mdash/> but we will be interested in vectors as algebraic objects in this class.
    Vectors will form the foundation for everything we will do in linear algebra.
    For now, the following definition will suffice.

        A (real) <term>vector</term>
        is a finite list of real numbers in a specified order.
        Each number in the list is referred to as an <term>entry</term>
        or <term>component</term>
        of the vector.

  <p>
    For the majority of this text,
    we will work with real vectors.
    However, a vector does not need to be restricted to have real entries.
    At times we will use complex vectors and even vectors in other types of sets.
    The types of sets we use will be ones that have structure just like the real numbers.
    Recall that a real number is a number that has a decimal representation,
    either finite or repeating
    (rational numbers)
    or otherwise
    (irrational numbers).
    We can add and multiply real numbers as we have done throughout our mathematical careers,
    and the real numbers have a certain structure given in the following theorem that we will treat 
    as an axiom <mdash/> that is,
    we assume these properties without proof.
    We denote the set of real numbers with the symbol <m>\R</m>.

    Any set that satisfies the properties listed in <xref ref="thm_1_d_reals"></xref> is 
    called a <term>field</term>.
    Our vectors are made from elements of a field,
    we call those elements of the field <term>scalars</term>.

    We will algebraically represent a vector as a matrix with one column.
    For example,
    <m>\vv = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1\\ 2 \end{array} \right]</m> is a vector with 2 entries,
    and we say that <m>\vv</m> is a vector in 2-space.
    By 2-space we mean <m>\R^2</m>,
    which can be geometrically modeled as the plane.
    Here the symbol <m>\R</m> indicates that the entries of <m>\vv</m> are real numbers and the 
    superscript 2 tells us that <m>\vv</m> has two entries.
    Similarly, vectors in <m>\R^3</m> have three entries,
    e.g., <m>\left[ \begin{array}{r} 1\\ 3\\ -1 \end{array} \right]</m>.
    The collection of column vectors with three entries can be geometrically modeled as three-dimensional space.
    If a vector <m>\vv</m> has <m>n</m> entries we say that <m>\vv</m> is a vector in <m>\R^n</m>
    (or <m>n</m>-space).
    Vectors are also often indicated with arrows,
    so we might also see a vector <m>\vv</m> written as <m>\overrightarrow{v}</m>.
    It is important when writing to differentiate between a vector <m>\vv</m> and a scalar <m>v</m>.
    These are quite different objects and it is up to us to make sure we are clear what a symbol represents.
    We will use boldface letters to represent vectors.
  </p>
  <p>
  <idx><h>vector</h><h>column</h></idx>
    A vector like <m>\left[ \begin{array}{c} 1\\ 2 \end{array}  \right]</m> is called a 
    <term>column vector</term>
    of <em>size</em> <m>2 \times 1</m>
    (two rows, one column).
    We can define an addition operation on two vectors of the same size by adding corresponding 
    components, such as
    <me>
      \left[ \begin{array}{r} 1 \\ -2 \end{array}  \right] + \left[ \begin{array}{c} 3 \\ 4 \end{array}  \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 4 \\ 2 \end{array}  \right]
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Similarly, we can define scalar multiplication of a vector by multiplying each component of the 
    vector by the scalar.
    For example,
    <me>
      3\left[ \begin{array}{c} 1\\ 2 \end{array}  \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 3\\ 6 \end{array}  \right]
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since we can add vectors and multiply vectors by scalars,
    we can then add together scalar multiples of vectors.
    For completeness,
    we define vector subtraction as adding a scalar multiple:
    <me>
      \vv - \vu = \vv + (-1)\vu
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This definition is equivalent to defining subtraction of <m>\vu</m> from <m>\vv</m> by 
    subtracting components of <m>\vu</m> from the corresponding components of <m>\vv</m>.

            In mathematics, any time we define operations on objects,
            such as addition of vectors, we ask which properties the operation has.
            For example, one might wonder if
            <m>\vu+\vv=\vv+\vu</m> for any two vectors <m>\vu, \vv</m> of the same size.
            If this property holds, we say that the
            <term>addition of vectors is a commutative operation</term>.
            However, to verify this property we cannot use examples since the property must hold 
            for any two vectors.
            For simplicity, we focus on two-dimensional vectors
            <m>\vu = \left[ \begin{array}{c} u_1\\ u_2 \end{array} \right]</m> and 
            <m>\vv = \left[ \begin{array}{c} v_1\\ v_2 \end{array} \right]</m>.
            Using these arbitrary vectors,
            can we say that <m>\vu+\vv=\vv+\vu</m>?
            If so, justify.
            If not, give a counterexample.
            (Note: Giving a counterexample is the best way to justify why a general statement 
            is not true.)

        <introduction>
          <p>
            One way to geometrically represent vectors with two components uses a point in the 
            plane to correspond to a vector.
            Specifically,
            the vector <m>\left[ \begin{array}{c} x \\ y \end{array} \right]</m> corresponds 
            to the point <m>(x, y)</m> in the plane.
            As a specific example, the vector
            <m>\left[ \begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 2 \end{array} \right]</m> corresponds to the point 
            <m>(1, 2)</m> in the plane.
            This representation will be especially handy when we consider infinite collections 
            of vectors as we will do in this problem.

                  plot the points that correspond to 5-6 scalar multiples of the vector <m>\left[ \begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 2 \end{array} \right]</m>.
                  Make sure to use variety of scalar multiples covering possibilities with <m>c>0,
                  c\lt 0, c>1, 0\lt c\lt 1, -1\lt c\lt 0</m>.
