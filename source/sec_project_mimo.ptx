  <title>Project: MIMO Systems and Householder Transformations</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In a simplified model,
      a MIMO system will have <m>k</m> transmitting antennas and <m>m</m> receiving antennas.
      We record a transmitted symbol in a vector <m>\vx = [x_1 \ x_2 \ \ldots \ x_k]^{\tr}</m>
      (one <m>x_i</m> for each transmitting antenna)
      and the received symbol as a vector <m>\vy = [y_1 \ y_2 \ \ldots \ y_m]^{\tr}</m>
      (one <m>y_j</m> for each received symbol).
    </p>
    <p>
      Between each transmit antenna and each receiver antenna is a fading channel.
      The MIMO system is the collection of fading channels.
      If we let <m>h_{ij}</m> be the fading between the <m>j</m>th transmitter and <m>i</m>th receiver,
      then we can represent this multipath fading as an
      <m>m \times k</m> matrix <m>H = [h_{ij}]</m>.
      We assume that there is also some noise in the received signal that we represent by <m>n_j</m>
      (for the <m>j</m>th receiving antenna).
      Our MIMO system is then represented as the matrix-vector equation
      <me>
        \vy = H\vx + \vn
      </me>,
      where <m>\vn = [n_1 \ n_2 \ \ldots \ n_m]^{\tr}</m>.
      The goal is to reproduce the original signal <m>\vx</m> from the received signal <m>\vy</m>.
      This is where the QR decomposition comes into play.

      <introduction>
      <p>
        To see why and how the QR decomposition is used in MIMO systems,
        we begin with an example.
        Assume that we have two transmitters and three receivers,
        and suppose <m>H = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 2\amp 1\\2\amp 1\\1\amp 5 \end{array}  \right]</m>.
        From this point,
        to simplify the situation we assume that noise is negligible and consider the system <m>\vy = H\vx</m>.
        Assume that the received signal is <m>\vy = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 2\\1\\4 \end{array}  \right]</m>.
      </p>
      </introduction>
        <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Show that the system <m>H \vx = \vy</m> is inconsistent.

          </statement>

        <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              When we receive a signal, we need to interpret it,
              and that is difficult if we cannot find a solution.
              One reason that the system might not have a solution is that the elements in <m>\vx</m> have to come from a specified alphabet,
              and so we are looking for solutions that are in that alphabet,
              and there may be no direct solution in that alphabet.
              As a result, we generally have to find a
              <q>best</q>
              solution in the alphabet space.
              That can be done with the QR decomposition.
              Assume that <m>H</m> has a QR decomposition <m>H = QR</m> with <m>Q</m> having orthonormal columns and <m>R</m> a diagonal matrix.
              Explain how the equation <m>\vy = H\vx</m> can be transformed into
              <men xml:id="eq_QR_system_example">
                Q^{\tr} \vy = R\vx
              </men>.

              Return to our example of <m>H = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 2\amp 1\\2\amp 1\\1\amp 5 \end{array}  \right]</m>.
              Assume that
              <me>
                H = QR =  \left[  \begin{array}{cr} \frac{2}{3}\amp  -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{6} \\ \frac{2}{3}\amp  -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{6} \\ \frac{1}{3}\amp  \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3} \end{array}  \right] \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 3\amp 3\\0\amp 3\sqrt{2} \end{array}  \right]
              </me>.
              Use <xref ref="eq_QR_system_example"/> to find <m>\vx</m> if <m>\vy = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 2\\1\\4 \end{array}  \right]</m>.
            </p>
          </statement>
        </task>
      
    </project>

    <p>
      In <xref ref="act_QR_example_1"></xref>
      we saw that a QR decomposition allows us to replace the system
      <m>\vy = H\vx</m> with an upper triangular system <m>Q^{\tr}\vy = R\vx</m> that has a solution.
      This solution is what is called a least squares solution
      (which we will discuss in more detail in a later section).
      The key to all of this is finding an efficient way to calculate a QR decomposition.
      This is the focus of the remainder of this project.

  <subsection>
    <title>Householder Transformations and the QR Decomposition</title>
    <p>
      There are three main ways to compute a QR decomposition.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The method discussed in this section uses Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization.
            This method is not recommended for numerical use as it is inherently numerically unstable.
            Under certain circumstances,
            cancellation can destroy the accuracy of the computed vectors and the resulting vectors may not be orthogonal.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The method that we will discuss in this project using Householder transformations
            (developed by Alston S. Householder).
            In Gaussian elimination,
            we can zero out entries below the diagonal by multiplying by elementary matrices to perform row operations.
            Householder transformations do something similar,
            allowing us to replace columns with columns of mostly zeros,
            which then allow for more efficient computations.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Givens (or Jacobi) rotations
            (used by W. Givens and originally invented by Jacobi for use with in solving the symmetric eigenvalue problem)
            is another method that allows us to selectively produce zeros into a matrix.
            We will focus on Householder transformations in this project.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The first step in a QR decomposition using Householder matrices is to create a matrix that is upper triangular.
      To get to this form, we use a <term>Householder transformation</term>.
      A Householder transformation
      (or matrix)
      is a matrix of the form
      <me>
        H = I - 2 \frac{\vv \vv^{\tr}}{||\vv||^2}
      </me>,
      where <m>\vv</m> is a vector in <m>\R^n</m> and <m>I</m> is the <m>n \times n</m> identity matrix.
    </p>

    <project>
      <introduction>
      <p>
        We will discover some properties of Householder transformations in this activity.
      </p>
      </introduction>
        <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Let <m>\vx</m> be any vector and let <m>\vy</m> be a unit vector.
              In this part of the exercise we show that,
              with a suitable choice of <m>\vv</m>,
              the Householder transformation <m>H</m> transforms <m>\vx</m> into a vector of the same length parallel to <m>\vy</m>.
              That is,
              <me>
                H \vx = -\sigma \vy
              </me>
              for some scalar <m>\sigma</m>.
              
              A similar argument shows that <m>H (\vx - \sigma \vy) = \sigma \vy</m>.
              Letting <m>\vy = \ve_1</m> gives us the following result.
              <lemma xml:id="lem_Householder">

                    let <m>\sigma = ||\vx||</m>, and let <m>\vv = \vx \pm \sigma \ve_1</m>.
                    Then <m>H \vx = \mp \sigma \ve_1</m>.

            <p>
              Let <m>\sigma = ||\vx||</m>, and let <m>\vv = \vx + \sigma \vy</m>.
              Apply <m>H</m> to <m>\vx</m>,
              factor out <m>\vx + \sigma \vy</m>,
              and ultimately show that <m>H \vx = -\sigma \vy</m>.
            </p>
          </hint>

        <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              The Householder matrix <m>H</m> has two other important properties.
              Show that <m>H</m> is symmetric and orthogonal.

    <p>
      There are many advantages to using Householder matrices.
      One is that instead of having to store all entries of the matrix <m>H = I - 2 \frac{\vv \vv^{\tr}}{||\vv||^2}</m>,
      all we need to store is the entries of <m>\vv</m>.
      Another advantage of Householder transformations is that they can be used to efficiently calculate QR decompositions.
      The next project activity shows how to use <xref ref="lem_Householder"></xref>
      and Householder transformations to compute a QR decomposition through an example.

      <xref ref="act_MIMO_Householder"></xref>
      illustrates the general method for finding a QR decomposition of a matrix <m>A</m> by using Householder transformations to reduce <m>A</m> to an upper triangular matrix <m>R</m>.
      The product of the Householder matrices is then the orthogonal matrix <m>Q</m>.
      One final note: You may have noticed that the matrix <m>Q</m> you found in this project was a square
      <m>5 \times 5</m> matrix and <m>R</m> was a <m>5 \times 3</m> matrix,
      and so they have different sizes than the QR decomposition in this section.
      We could use the Gram-Schmidt process to obtain these larger matrices by extending the columns of a
      <m>5 \times 3</m> matrix <m>Q</m> to form an orthonormal basis for <m>\R^5</m>.
      However, if we want a QR decomposition for <m>A</m> in which <m>Q</m> is <m>5 \times 3</m> and <m>R</m> is
      <m>3 \times 3</m> from the work we did in <xref ref="act_MIMO_Householder"></xref>,
      we can simply delete the last two columns of the matrix <m>Q</m> and the last two rows of the matrix <m>R</m> we calculated.
      This smaller QR decomposition is often referred to as a
      <term>thin</term> QR decomposition.
