  <title>Application: Linear Differential Equations</title>
  <p>
    A body in motion obeys Newton's second law that force equals mass times acceleration,
    or <m>F = ma</m>.
    Here <m>F</m> is the force acting on the object,
    <m>m</m> the mass of the object,
    and <m>a</m> the acceleration of the object.
    For example, if a mass is hanging from a spring,
    gravity acts to pull the mass downward and the spring acts to pull the mass up.
    Hooke?s law says that the force of the spring acting on mass is proportional to the displacement <m>y</m> of the spring from equilibrium.
    There is also a damping force that weakens the action of the spring that might be due to air resistance or the medium in which the system is enclosed.
    If this mass is not too large,
    then the resistance can be taken to be proportional to the velocity <m>v</m> of the mass.
    This produces forces <m>F = ma</m> acting to pull the mass down and forces <m>-ky</m> and <m>- bv</m> acting in the opposite direction,
    where <m>k</m> and <m>b</m> are constant.
    A similar type of analysis would apply to an object falling through the air,
    where the resistant to falling could be proportional to the velocity of the object.
    Since <m>v = y'</m> and <m>a = y''</m>,
    equating the forces produces the equation'

      my'' = -ky-by'
    </men>.

  <idx><h>differential equation</h></idx>
    Any equation that involves one or more derivatives of a function is called a
    <term>differential equation</term>.
    Differential equations are used to model many different types of behavior in disciplines including engineering,
    physics, economics, and biology.
    Later in this section we will see how differential equations can be represented by linear transformations,
    and see how we can exploit this idea to solve certain types of differential equations
    (including <xref ref="eq_de_1"/>).
