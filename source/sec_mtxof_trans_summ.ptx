        The standard matrix for a linear transformation <m>T</m> from <m>\R^n</m> to <m>\R^m</m> is the matrix
        <me>
          A = [T(\ve_1) \ T(\ve_2) \ \cdots \ T(\ve_n)]
        </me>,
        where <m>\{\ve_1, \ve_2, \ldots, \ve_n\}</m> is the standard basis for <m>\R^n</m>.
        Then <m>T</m> is the matrix transformation defined by
        <m>T(\vx) = A\vx</m> for all <m>\vx</m> in <m>\R^n</m>.
      </p>

        Let <m>V</m> be an <m>n</m> dimensional vector space and <m>W</m> an <m>m</m> dimensional vector space and suppose
        <m>T : V \to W</m> is a linear transformation.
        Let <m>\CB = \{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_n\}</m> be a basis for <m>V</m> and
        <m>\CC = \{\vw_1, \vw_2, \ldots, \vw_m\}</m> a basis for <m>W</m>.
        The matrix for <m>T</m> with respect to the bases <m>\CB</m> and <m>\CC</m> is the matrix
        <me>
          [T]_{\CB}^{\CC} = \left[  [T(\vv_1)]_{\CC}  \ [T(\vv_2)]_{\CC}  \ [T(\vv_3)]_{\CC}  \ \cdots  \ [T(\vv_n)]_{\CC} \right]
        </me>.
        If <m>V=W</m> and <m>\CC = \CB</m>,
        then we use the notation <m>[T]_{\CB}</m> as a shorthand for <m>[T]_{\CB}^{\CC}</m>.
        The matrix <m>[T]_{\CB}^{\CC}</m> has the property that
        <me>
          [T(\vv)]_{\CC} = [T]_{\CB}^{\CC} [\vv]_{\CB}
        </me>
        for any <m>\vv</m> in <m>V</m>.

        The matrix for a linear transformation allows us to represent any linear transformation between finite dimensional vectors spaces as a matrix transformation.
        When we view a linear transformation <m>T</m> as a matrix transformation,
        we are able to use the matrix tools we have developed to understand <m>T</m>.
