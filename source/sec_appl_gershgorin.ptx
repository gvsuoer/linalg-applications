  <title>Application: The Gershgorin Disk Theorem</title>
  <p>
    We have now seen different methods for calculating/approximating eigenvalues of a matrix.
    The algebraic method using the characteristic polynomial can provide exact values,
    but only in cases where the size of the matrix is small.
    Methods like the power method allow us to approximate eigenvalues in many,
    but not all, cases.
    These approximation techniques can be made more efficient if we have some idea of where the eigenvalues are.
    The Gershgorin Disc Theorem is a useful tool that can quickly provide bounds on the location of eigenvalues using elementary calculations.
    For example,
    using the Gershsgorin Disk Theorem we can quickly tell that the real parts of the eigenvalues of the matrix
    <me>
      \left[ \begin{array}{ccr} 3\amp 1\amp -1 \\ 0\amp -1+i\amp i \\ 2\amp 1\amp -2i \end{array}  \right]
    </me>
    lie between <m>-4</m> and 5 and the imaginary parts lie between <m>-5</m> and 2.
    Even more, we can say that the eigenvalues lie in the disks
    (called <term>Gershgorin disks</term>)
    shown in <xref ref="F_Gershgorin_1"></xref>.
