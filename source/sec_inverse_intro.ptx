    To this point we have solved systems of linear equations with matrix forms
    <m>A \vx = \vb</m> by row reducing the augmented matrices <m>[A \ | \ \vb]</m>.
    These linear matrix-vector equations should remind us of linear algebraic equations of the form <m>ax = b</m>,
    where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are real numbers.
    Recall that we solved an equation of the form <m>ax=b</m> by dividing both sides by <m>a</m>
    (provided <m>a \neq 0</m>),
    giving the solution <m>x = \frac{b}{a}</m>,
    or equivalently <m>x = a^{-1}b</m>.
    The important property that the number <m>a^{-1}</m> has that allows us to solve a linear equation in this way is that <m>a^{-1}a = 1</m>,
    so that <m>a^{-1}</m> is the multiplicative inverse of <m>a</m>.
    We can solve certain types of matrix equations <m>A \vx = \vb</m> in the same way,
    provided we can find a matrix <m>A^{-1}</m> with similar properties.
    We investigate this situation in this section.

          Before we define the inverse matrix,
          recall that the identity matrix <m>I_n</m> (with 1's along the diagonal and 0's everywhere else) is a multiplicative identity in the set of <m>n \times n</m> matrices
          (just like the real number 1 is the multiplicative identity in the set of real number).
          In particular,
          <m>I_nA = AI_n = A</m> for any <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m>.
          Now we can generalize the inverse operation to matrices.
          For an <m>n\times n</m> matrix <m>A</m>,
          we define <m>A^{-1}</m> to be the matrix which when multiplied by <m>A</m> gives us the identity matrix.
          In other words, <m>AA^{-1}=A^{-1}A=I_n</m>.
          We can find the inverse of a matrix in a calculator by using the <m>x^{-1}</m> button.
          For each of the following matrices,
          determine if the inverse exists using your calculator or other appropriate technology.
          If the inverse does exist,
          write down the inverse and check that it satisfies the defining property of the inverse matrix,
          that is <m>AA^{-1}=A^{-1}A=I_n</m>.
          If the inverse doesn't exist,
          write down any error you received from the technology.
          Can you guess why the inverse does not exist for these matrices?

          Now we turn to the question of how to find the inverse of a matrix in general.
          With this approach,
          we will be able to determine which matrices have inverses as well.
          We will consider the <m>2 \times 2</m> case to make the calculations easier.
          Suppose <m>A</m> is a <m>2 \times 2</m> matrix.
          Our goal is to find a matrix <m>B</m> so that <m>AB = I_2</m> and <m>BA = I_2</m>.
          If such a matrix exists,
          we will call <m>B</m> the inverse,
          <m>A^{-1}</m>, of <m>A</m>.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                What does the equation <m>AB = I_2</m> tell us about the size of the matrix <m>B</m>?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Now let <m>A = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 1\amp 2 \\ 1\amp 3 \end{array}  \right]</m>.
                We want to find a  matrix <m>B</m> so that <m>AB = I_2</m>.
                Suppose <m>B</m> has columns <m>\vb_1</m> and <m>\vb_2</m>, i.e.
                <m>B = [\vb_1 \ \vb_2]</m>.
                Our definition of matrix multiplication shows that
                <me>
                  AB = [A\vb_1 \ A\vb_2]
                </me>.
                <ol label="i">
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      If <m>AB = I_2</m>, what must <m>A\vb_1</m> and <m>A \vb_2</m> equal?

                      Use the result from part (a) to set up two matrix equations to solve to find <m>\vb_1</m> and <m>\vb_2</m>.
                      Then find <m>\vb_1</m> and <m>\vb_2</m>.
                      As a result, find the matrix <m>B</m>.

                      When we solve the two systems we have found a matrix <m>B</m> so that <m>AB = I_2</m>.
                      Is this enough to say that <m>B</m> is the inverse of <m>A</m>?
                      If not, what else do we need to know to verify that <m>B</m> is in fact <m>A^{-1}</m>?
                      Verify that <m>B</m> is <m>A^{-1}</m>.

          A matrix inverse is extremely useful in solving matrix equations and can help us in solving systems of equations.
          Suppose that <m>A</m> is an invertible matrix,
          i.e., there exists <m>A^{-1}</m> such that <m>AA^{-1}=A^{-1}A=I_n</m>.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Consider the system <m>A\vx=\vb</m>.
                Use the inverse of <m>A</m> to show that this system has a solution for every <m>\vb</m> and find an expression for this solution in terms of <m>\vb</m> and <m>A^{-1}</m>.
                (Note that since matrix multiplication is not commutative,
                we have to pay attention to the order in which we multiply matrices.
                For example, <m>A^{-1}AB=B</m> while we cannot simplify
                <m>ABA^{-1}</m> to <m>B</m> unless <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> commute.)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If <m>A</m>,
                <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m> are matrices and <m>A+C = B+C</m>,
                then we can subtract the matrix <m>C</m> from both sides to see that <m>A = B</m>.
                We saw in <xref ref="sec_matrix_operations">Section</xref>
                that there is no corresponding general cancellation property for matrix multiplication when we found that <m>AB=AC</m> could hold while <m>B\neq C</m>.
                However, we can cancel <m>A</m> from this equation in certain circumstances.
                Suppose that <m>AB=AC</m> and that <m>A</m> is an invertible matrix.
                Show that we can cancel <m>A</m> in this case and conclude that <m>B=C</m>.
                (Note: When simplifying the product of matrices,
                again keep in mind that matrix multiplication is not commutative.)
