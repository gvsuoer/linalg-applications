  <p>
    In this section we learned about the row echelon and reduced row echelon forms of a matrix and some of the things these forms tell us about solutions to systems of linear equations.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        A matrix is in row echelon form if
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            All nonzero rows are above any rows of all zeros.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Each <em>pivot</em>
            (the first nonzero entry)
            of a row is in a column to the right of the pivot of the row above it.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Once an augmented matrix is in row echelon form,
        we can use back substitution to solve the corresponding linear system.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        To reduce a matrix to row echelon form we do the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Begin with the leftmost nonzero column
            (if there is one).
            This will be a pivot column.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Select a nonzero entry in this pivot column as a pivot.
            If necessary,
            interchange rows to move this entry to the first row
            (this entry will be a pivot).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Use row operations to create zeros in all positions below the pivot.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Cover (or ignore) the row containing the pivot position and cover all rows, if any,
            above it.
            Apply the preceding steps to the submatrix that remains.
            Repeat the process until there are no more nonzero rows to modify.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A matrix is in reduced row echelon form if it is in row echelon form and
        <ol>
          <li>
            <title>(3)</title>
            <p>
              The pivot in each nonzero row is 1.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title>(4)</title>
            <p>
              Each pivot is the only nonzero entry in its column.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        To obtain the reduced row echelon form from the row echelon form,
        beginning with the rightmost pivot and working upward and to the left,
        create zeros above each pivot.
        If a pivot is not 1, make it 1 by an appropriate row multiplication.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Both row echelon forms of an augmented matrix tell us about the number of solutions to the corresponding linear system.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              A linear system is inconsistent if and only if a row echelon form of the augmented matrix of the system contains a row of the form
              <me>
                [0 \ 0 \ 0 \ \cdots \ 0 \ *]
              </me>,
              where <m>*</m> is not zero.
              Another way to say this is that a linear system is inconsistent if and only if the last column of the augmented matrix of the system is a pivot column.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              A consistent linear system will have a unique solution if and only if each column but the last in the augmented matrix of the system is a pivot column.
              This is equivalent to saying that a consistent linear system will have a unique solution if and only if the consistent system has no free variables.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              A consistent linear system will have infinitely many solutions if and only if the coefficient matrix of the system contains a non-pivot column.
              In that case,
              the free variables corresponding to the non-pivot columns can be chosen arbitrarily and the basic variables corresponding to pivot columns can be written in terms of the free variables.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              A linear system can have no solutions,
              exactly one solution, or infinitely many solutions.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
