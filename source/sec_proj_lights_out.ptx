  <title>Project: Solving the Lights Out Game</title>
  <p>
    The Lights Out game starts with a
    <m>5 \times 5</m> grid on which some of the squares are lit (on) and some are not lit
    (off).
    We will call such a state a <term>configuration</term>.
    Pressing a square that is on turns it off and changes the state of all adjacent
    (vertically and horizontally)
    squares, and pressing a square that is off turns it on and changes the state of all adjacent
    (vertically and horizontally)
    squares.
    To model this situation,
    we consider the number system
    <m>\Z_2 = \{0,1\}</m> consisting only of 0 and 1, where 0 represents the off state and 1 the on state.
    We can also think of 1 as the act of pressing a square and 0 as the act of not pressing <mdash/> that is,
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>0+0 = 0</m> (not pressing an off square leaves it off),
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>0+1 = 1 = 1 + 0</m> (pressing an off square turns it on or not pressing a lit square leaves it lit),
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>1+1 = 0</m>
          (pressing a lit square turns it off).
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    The numbers 0 and 1 in <m>\Z_2</m> will be the only numbers we use when playing the Lights Out game,
    so all of our matrix entries will be in <m>\Z_2</m> and all of our calculations are done in <m>\Z_2</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are two ways we can view a Lights Out game.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          We can view each configuration as a <m>5 \times 5</m> matrix.
          In this situation,
          we label the entries in the grid as shown in <xref ref="F_LO"></xref>.
          Each entry in the grid will be assigned a 0 or 1 according to whether the light in that entry is off or on.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          For our purposes a better way to visualize a Lights Out configuration is as a <m>25 \times 1</m> vector.
          The components in this vector correspond to the entries in the
          <m>5 \times 5</m> grid with the correspondence given by the numbering demonstrated in <xref ref="F_LO"></xref>
          (for the sake of space, this array is shown in a row instead of a column).
          Again, each component is assigned a 0 or 1 according to whether the light for that entry is off or on.
          In this view,
          each configuration is a vector with 25 components in <m>\Z_2</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

    <caption>Two representations of the Lights Out game.</caption>
    <image width="30%" source="LO"/>
    <image width="90%" source="LO_vector"/>
  </figure>

  <p>
    We will take the latter perspective and view the Lights Out game as if it is played on a
    <m>25 \times 1</m> board with entries in <m>\Z_2</m>.
    The space of all of these Lights Out configurations is denoted as <m>\Z_2^{25}</m>
    (similar to <m>\R^{25}</m>,
    but with entries in <m>\Z_2</m> rather than <m>\R</m>).
    Since <m>\Z_2</m> is a field,
    the space <m>\Z_2^{25}</m> is a vector space just as <m>\R^{25}</m> is.
    This is the environment in which we will play the Lights Out game.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we think about the game as played on a <m>25 \times 1</m> board,
    then pressing a square correlates to selecting one of the 25 components of a configuration vector.
    Each time we press a square,
    we make a move that changes the status of that square and all the squares vertically or horizontally adjacent to it from the <m>5 \times 5</m> board.
    Recalling that adding 1 to a square has the effect of changing its status
    (from on to off or off to on),
    and each move that we make in the game can be represented as a
    <m>25 \times 1</m> vector that is added to a configuration.
    For example,
    the move of pressing the first square is given by adding the vector
    <me>
      \vm_{1} = [ 1 \ 1 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 1 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0\  0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 ]^{\tr}
    </me>
    to a configuration vector and the move of pressing the second square is represented by adding the vector
    <me>
      \vm_{2} = [ 1 \ 1 \ 1 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 1 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0\  0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 ]^{\tr}
    </me>.
  </p>

            Let <m>M = [m_{ij}] = \left[\vm_1 | \vm_2 | \cdots | \vm_{25} \right]</m>.
            Explain why <m>m_{ij} = m_{ji}</m> for each <m>i</m> and <m>j</m>.
            In other words, explain why <m>M^{\tr} = M</m>.
            (Such a matrix is called a <em>symmetric</em> matrix.)

  <p>
    The goal of the Lights Out game is to begin with an initial configuration <m>\vc</m> (a vector in
    <m>\Z_2^{25}</m>) and determine if we can apply a sequence of moves to obtain the configuration in which all the entries are 0
    (or all the lights are off).
    The vector in <m>\Z_2^{25}</m> of all 0s is the zero vector in
    <m>\Z_2^{25}</m> and we will denote it as <m>\vzero</m>.
    Some basic algebra of vector addition in <m>\Z_2</m>
    (or mod 2)
    will help us understand the strategy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Start with a configuration <m>\vc</m>.
    If we press the <m>i</m>th square,
    then we obtain the new configuration <m>\vc_1 = \vm_i + \vc</m>
    (where each move <m>\vm_i</m> is also in <m>\Z_2^{25}</m>).

    What we have seen is that to play the game we are really looking for scalars <m>x_1</m>,
    <m>x_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>x_{25}</m> in <m>\Z_2</m>
    (in other words, either 0 or 1)
    so that

  <p>
    To find conditions under which a Lights Out game is not solvable,
    we will demonstrate that if <m>A</m> is an <m>n \times n</m> matrix,
    then the scalar product of any vector in
    <m>\Nul A^{\tr}</m> with any column of <m>A</m> is <m>\vzero</m>.
    Let <m>A = [a_{ij}]</m> be an
    <m>n \times n</m> matrix with columns <m>\va_1</m>,
    <m>\va_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\va_n</m>.
    Represent the entries in the <m>i</m>th column as
    <m>\va_i = [a_{1i} \ a_{2i} \ \ldots \ a_{ni}]^{\tr}</m> for each <m>i</m> between 1 and <m>n</m>.
    Note that <m>\va_i</m> is also the <m>i</m>th row of <m>A^{\tr}</m>.
    Also, let <m>\vx = [x_1 \ x_2 \ \ldots \ x_n]^{\tr}</m> be a vector in <m>\Nul A^{\tr}</m>.
    Then <m>A^{\tr} \vx = \vzero</m>.
    Using the row-column method of multiplying a matrix by a vector,
    when we multiply the <m>i</m>th row of <m>A^{\tr}</m> with <m>\vx</m> we obtain
    <men xml:id="eq_LO_dp">
      a_{1i}x_1 + a_{2i}x_2 + \cdots + a_{ni}x_n = 0
    </men>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This equation is valid for each <m>i</m> between 1 and <m>n</m>.
    Recall that the sum in <xref ref="eq_LO_dp"/> is the scalar product of <m>\va_i</m> and <m>\vx</m> and is denoted <m>\va_i \cdot \vx</m>.
    That is,
    <me>
      \va_i \cdot \vx = a_{i1}x_1 + a_{i2}x_2 + \cdots + a_{in}x_n
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The fact that <m>\vx</m> is in <m>\Nul A^{\tr}</m> means
    <m>\va_i \cdot \vx = \vzero</m> for every <m>i</m> between 1 and <m>n</m>.
    In other words, the scalar product of any vector in
    <m>\Nul A^{\tr}</m> with any column of <m>A</m> is <m>\vzero</m>.
    (When the scalar product of two vectors is <m>\vzero</m>,
    we call the vectors <term>orthogonal</term>
    <mdash/> a fancy word for
    <q>perpendicular</q>.)
    Since scalar products are linear,
    we can extend this result to the following.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm_LO_Nul_Col">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be an <m>n \times n</m> matrix.
        If <m>\vx</m> is any vector in <m>\Col A</m> and <m>\vy</m> is any vector in <m>\Nul A^{\tr}</m>,
        then <m>\vx \cdot \vy = 0</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    With <xref ref="thm_LO_Nul_Col"></xref>
    in mind we can return to our analysis of the Lights Out game,
    applying this result to the matrix <m>M</m>.
