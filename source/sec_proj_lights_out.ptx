  <title>Project: Solving the Lights Out Game</title>
  <p>
    The Lights Out game starts with a
    <m>5 \times 5</m> grid on which some of the squares are lit (on) and some are not lit
    (off).
    We will call such a state a <em>configuration</em>.
    Pressing a square that is on turns it off and changes the state of all adjacent
    (vertically and horizontally)
    squares, and pressing a square that is off turns it on and changes the state of all adjacent
    (vertically and horizontally)
    squares.
    To model this situation,
    we consider the number system
    <m>\Z_2 = \{0,1\}</m> consisting only of 0 and 1, where 0 represents the off state and 1 the on state.
    We can also think of 1 as the act of pressing a square and 0 as the act of not pressing <mdash/> that is,
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>0+0 = 0</m> (not pressing an off square leaves it off),
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>0+1 = 1 = 1 + 0</m> (pressing an off square turns it on or not pressing a lit square leaves it lit),
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>1+1 = 0</m>
          (pressing a lit square turns it off).
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    The numbers 0 and 1 in <m>\Z_2</m> will be the only numbers we use when playing the Lights Out game,
    so all of our matrix entries will be in <m>\Z_2</m> and all of our calculations are done in <m>\Z_2</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are two ways we can view a Lights Out game.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          We can view each configuration as a <m>5 \times 5</m> matrix.
          In this situation,
          we label the entries in the grid as shown in <xref ref="F_LO"></xref>.
          Each entry in the grid will be assigned a 0 or 1 according to whether the light in that entry is off or on.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          For our purposes a better way to visualize a Lights Out configuration is as a <m>25 \times 1</m> vector.
          The components in this vector correspond to the entries in the
          <m>5 \times 5</m> grid with the correspondence given by the numbering demonstrated in <xref ref="F_LO"></xref>
          (for the sake of space, this array is shown in a row instead of a column).
          Again, each component is assigned a 0 or 1 according to whether the light for that entry is off or on.
          In this view,
          each configuration is a vector with 25 components in <m>\Z_2</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="F_LO">
    <caption>Two representations of the Lights Out game.</caption>
    <image width="50%" source="LO"/>
    <image width="50%" source="LO_vector"/>
  </figure>
  <p>
    We will take the latter perspective and view the Lights Out game as if it is played on a
    <m>25 \times 1</m> board with entries in <m>\Z_2</m>.
    The space of all of these Lights Out configurations is denoted as <m>\Z_2^{25}</m>
    (similar to <m>\R^{25}</m>,
    but with entries in <m>\Z_2</m> rather than <m>\R</m>).
    Since <m>\Z_2</m> is a field,
    the space <m>\Z_2^{25}</m> is a vector space just as <m>\R^{25}</m> is.
    This is the environment in which we will play the Lights Out game.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we think about the game as played on a <m>25 \times 1</m> board,
    then pressing a square correlates to selecting one of the 25 components of a configuration vector.
    Each time we press a square,
    we make a move that changes the status of that square and all the squares vertically or horizontally adjacent to it from the <m>5 \times 5</m> board.
    Recalling that adding 1 to a square has the effect of changing its status
    (from on to off or off to on),
    and each move that we make in the game can be represented as a
    <m>25 \times 1</m> vector that is added to a configuration.
    For example,
    the move of pressing the first square is given by adding the vector
    <me>
      \vm_{1} = [ 1 \ 1 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 1 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0\  0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 ]^{\tr}
    </me>
    to a configuration vector and the move of pressing the second square is represented by adding the vector
    <me>
      \vm_{2} = [ 1 \ 1 \ 1 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 1 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0\  0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0 ]^{\tr}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <activity>
    <p>
      Let <m>\vm_i</m> be the move of pressing the <m>i</m>th square for <m>i</m> from 1 to 25.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Find vector representations for <m>\vm_9</m> and <m>\vm_{22}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Let <m>M = [m_{ij}] = \left[\vm_1 | \vm_2 | \cdots | \vm_{25} \right]</m>.
            Explain why <m>m_{ij} = m_{ji}</m> for each <m>i</m> and <m>j</m>.
            In other words, explain why <m>M^{\tr} = M</m>.
            (Such a matrix is called a <em>symmetric</em> matrix.)
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

  <p>
    The goal of the Lights Out game is to begin with an initial configuration <m>\vc</m> (a vector in
    <m>\Z_2^{25}</m>) and determine if we can apply a sequence of moves to obtain the configuration in which all the entries are 0
    (or all the lights are off).
    The vector in <m>\Z_2^{25}</m> of all 0s is the zero vector in
    <m>\Z_2^{25}</m> and we will denote it as <m>\vzero</m>.
    Some basic algebra of vector addition in <m>\Z_2</m>
    (or mod 2)
    will help us understand the strategy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Start with a configuration <m>\vc</m>.
    If we press the <m>i</m>th square,
    then we obtain the new configuration <m>\vc_1 = \vm_i + \vc</m>
    (where each move <m>\vm_i</m> is also in <m>\Z_2^{25}</m>).

            What happens if we press the <m>i</m>th square twice in a row?

          <p>
            Explain why applying move <m>\vm_i</m> then move <m>\vm_j</m> is the same as applying move <m>\vm_j</m>,

            Explain how the answers to the previous two questions show that to play the game we only need to determine which buttons to press
            (and only once each)
            without worrying about the order in which the buttons are pressed.

    What we have seen is that to play the game we are really looking for scalars <m>x_1</m>,
    <m>x_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>x_{25}</m> in <m>\Z_2</m>
    (in other words, either 0 or 1)
    so that
    <men xml:id="eq_LO1">

  <p>
    To find conditions under which a Lights Out game is not solvable,
    we will demonstrate that if <m>A</m> is an <m>n \times n</m> matrix,
    then the scalar product of any vector in
    <m>\Nul A^{\tr}</m> with any column of <m>A</m> is <m>\vzero</m>.
    Let <m>A = [a_{ij}]</m> be an
    <m>n \times n</m> matrix with columns <m>\va_1</m>,
    <m>\va_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\va_n</m>.
    Represent the entries in the <m>i</m>th column as
    <m>\va_i = [a_{1i} \ a_{2i} \ \ldots \ a_{ni}]^{\tr}</m> for each <m>i</m> between 1 and <m>n</m>.
    Note that <m>\va_i</m> is also the <m>i</m>th row of <m>A^{\tr}</m>.
    Also, let <m>\vx = [x_1 \ x_2 \ \ldots \ x_n]^{\tr}</m> be a vector in <m>\Nul A^{\tr}</m>.
    Then <m>A^{\tr} \vx = \vzero</m>.
    Using the row-column method of multiplying a matrix by a vector,
    when we multiply the <m>i</m>th row of <m>A^{\tr}</m> with <m>\vx</m> we obtain
    <men xml:id="eq_LO_dp">
      a_{1i}x_1 + a_{2i}x_2 + \cdots + a_{ni}x_n = 0
    </men>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This equation is valid for each <m>i</m> between 1 and <m>n</m>.
    Recall that the sum in <xref ref="eq_LO_dp"/> is the scalar product of <m>\va_i</m> and <m>\vx</m> and is denoted <m>\va_i \cdot \vx</m>.
    That is,
    <me>
      \va_i \cdot \vx = a_{i1}x_1 + a_{i2}x_2 + \cdots + a_{in}x_n
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The fact that <m>\vx</m> is in <m>\Nul A^{\tr}</m> means
    <m>\va_i \cdot \vx = \vzero</m> for every <m>i</m> between 1 and <m>n</m>.
    In other words, the scalar product of any vector in
    <m>\Nul A^{\tr}</m> with any column of <m>A</m> is <m>\vzero</m>.
    (When the scalar product of two vectors is <m>\vzero</m>,
    we call the vectors <em>orthogonal</em>
    <mdash/> a fancy word for
    <q>perpendicular</q>.)
    Since scalar products are linear,
    we can extend this result to the following.
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="thm_LO_Nul_Col">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be an <m>n \times n</m> matrix.
        If <m>\vx</m> is any vector in <m>\Col A</m> and <m>\vy</m> is any vector in <m>\Nul A^{\tr}</m>,
        then <m>\vx \cdot \vy = 0</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    With <xref ref="thm_LO_Nul_Col"></xref>
    in mind we can return to our analysis of the Lights Out game,
    applying this result to the matrix <m>M</m>.

      Now that we know which Lights Out games can be solved,
      let <m>\vc</m> be an initial configuration to a solvable Lights Out game.
      Explain how to find a solution to this game.
      Will the solution be unique?
      Explain.

    Now that we have a strategy for solving the Lights Out game,
    use it to solve random puzzles at \url{https://www.geogebra.org/m/wcmctahp}, or create your own game to solve.
