        A matrix <m>D = [d_{ij}]</m> is a diagonal matrix if
        <m>d_{ij} = 0</m> whenever <m>i \neq j</m>.

        A matrix <m>A</m> is diagonalizable if there is an invertible matrix <m>P</m> so that
        <m>P^{-1}AP</m> is a diagonal matrix.
      </p>

        Two matrices <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are similar if there is an invertible matrix <m>P</m> so that
        <me>
          B = P^{-1}AP
        </me>.
      </p>

        Similar matrices have the same determinants,
        same characteristic polynomials, and same eigenvalues.
        Note that similar matrices do not necessarily have the same eigenvectors corresponding to the same eigenvalues.

        An <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> is diagonalizable if and only if <m>A</m> has <m>n</m> linearly independent eigenvectors.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        When an <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> is diagonalizable,
        then <m>P = [ \vv_1 \ \vv_2 \ \vv_3 \ \cdots \ \vv_n]</m> is invertible and <m>P^{-1}AP</m> is diagonal,
        where <m>\vv_1</m>, <m>\vv_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
        <m>\vv_n</m> are <m>n</m> linearly independent eigenvectors for <m>A</m>.
      </p>

        One use for diagonalization is that once we have diagonalized a matrix <m>A</m> we can quickly and easily compute powers of <m>A</m>.
        Diagonalization can also help us understand the actions of matrix transformations.
