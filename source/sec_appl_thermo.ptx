  <title>Application: Modeling the Second Law of Thermodynamics</title>
  <p>
    Pour cream into your cup of coffee and the cream spreads out;
    straighten up your room and it soon becomes messy again;
    when gasoline is mixed with air in a car's cylinders,
    it explodes if a spark is introduced.
    In each of these cases a transition from a low energy state
    (your room is straightened up)
    to a higher energy state (a messy,
    disorganized room) occurs.
    This can be described by entropy <mdash/> a measure of the energy in a system.
    Low energy is organized
    (like ice cubes)
    and higher energy is not
    (like water vapor).
    It is a fundamental property of energy
    (as described by the second law of thermodynamics)
    that the entropy of a system cannot decrease.
    In other words, in the absence of any external intervention,
    things never become more organized.

    The Ehrenfest model<fn>
    named after Paul and Tatiana Ehrenfest who introduced it in
    <q>{\</q>
    U}ber zwei bekannte Einw&#xe4;nde gegen das Boltzmannsche H-Theorem,''
    <em>Physikalishce Zeitschrift</em>,
    vol. 8 (1907), pp. 311-314)
    </fn> is a Markov process proposed to explain the statistical interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics using the diffusion of gas molecules.
    This process can be modeled as a problem of balls and bins,
    as we will do later in this section.
    The characteristic polynomial of the transition matrix will help us find the eigenvalues and allow us to analyze our model.
