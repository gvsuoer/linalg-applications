  <p>
    We have seen that orthogonal bases make computations very convenient,
    and the Gram-Schmidt process allowed us to create orthogonal bases in <m>\R^n</m> using the dot product as inner product.
    In this section we will see how the Gram-Schmidt process works in any inner product space.
