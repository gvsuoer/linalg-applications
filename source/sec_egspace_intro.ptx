      Consider the matrix transformation <m>T</m> from <m>\R^2</m> to <m>\R^2</m> defined by <m>T(\vx) = A \vx</m>, where
      <me>
        A = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 3\amp 1\\1\amp 3 \end{array}  \right]
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are interested in understanding what this matrix transformation does to vectors in <m>\R^2</m>.
      The matrix <m>A</m> has eigenvalues <m>\lambda_1 = 2</m> and
      <m>\lambda_2 = 4</m> with corresponding eigenvectors
      <m>\vv_1 = \left[ \begin{array}{r} -1\\1 \end{array}  \right]</m> and <m>\vv_2 = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1\\1 \end{array}  \right]</m>.

        <statement>
          <p>
            Explain why <m>\vv_1</m> and <m>\vv_2</m> are linearly independent.

          <p>
            Explain why any vector <m>\vb</m> in <m>\R^2</m> can be written uniquely as a linear combination of <m>\vv_1</m> and <m>\vv_2</m>.

            We now consider the action of the matrix transformation <m>T</m> on a linear combination of <m>\vv_1</m> and <m>\vv_2</m>.
            Explain why
            <men xml:id="eq_3_c_1">
              T(c_1\vv_1 + c_2 \vv_2) = 2c_1\vv_1 + 4c_2 \vv_2
            </men>.

  <p>
    Equation <xref ref="eq_3_c_1"/> illustrates that it would be convenient to view the action of <m>T</m> in the coordinate system where
    <m>\Span\{\vv_1\}</m> serves as the <m>x</m>-axis and
    <m>\Span\{\vv_2\}</m> as the <m>y</m>-axis.
    In this case,
    we can visualize that when we apply the transformation <m>T</m> to a vector
    <m>\vb = c_1 \vv_1 + c_2 \vv_2</m> in <m>\R^2</m> the result is an output vector is scaled by a factor of <m>2</m> in the <m>\vv_1</m> direction and by a factor of <m>4</m> in the <m>\vv_2</m> direction.
    For example, consider the box with vertices at <m>(0,0)</m>,
    <m>\vv_1</m>, <m>\vv_2</m>,
    and <m>\vv_1+\vv_2</m> as shown at left in <xref ref="F_3_c_1"></xref>.
    The transformation <m>T</m> stretches this box by a factor of <m>2</m> in the <m>\vv_1</m> direction and a factor of <m>4</m> in the <m>\vv_2</m> direction as illustrated at right in <xref ref="F_3_c_1"></xref>.
    In this situation,
    the eigenvalues and eigenvectors provide the most convenient perspective through which to visualize the action of the transformation <m>T</m>.
    Here, <m>\Span\{\vv_1\}</m> and
    <m>\Span\{\vv_2\}</m> are the eigenspaces of the matrix <m>A</m>.

  <p>
    This geometric perspective illustrates how each the span of each eigenvalue of <m>A</m> tells us something important about <m>A</m>.
    In this section we explore the idea of eigenvalues and spaces defined by eigenvectors in more detail.
