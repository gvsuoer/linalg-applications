  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>
    In <m>\R^n</m> we defined a basis for a subspace <m>W</m> of <m>\R^n</m> to be a minimal spanning set for <m>W</m>,
    or a linearly independent spanning set
    (see <xref ref="def_1_f_basis"></xref>).
    So to consider the idea of a basis in a vector space,
    we will need the notion of linear independence in that context.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since we can add vectors and multiply vectors by scalars in any vector space,
    and because we have a zero vector in any vector space,
    we can define linear independence of a finite set of vectors in any vector space as follows
    (compare to <xref ref="def_linear_independence_Rn"></xref>).
  </p>
  <definition xml:id="def_vs_linear_independence">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A set <m>\{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_k\}</m> of vectors in a vector space <m>V</m> is
        <term>linearly independent</term><idx><h>linearly independent vectors in a vector space</h></idx> if the vector equation
        <me>
          x_1 \vv_1 + x_2 \vv_2 + \cdots + x_k \vv_k = \vzero
        </me>
        for scalars <m>x_1, x_2, \ldots,
        x_k</m> has only the trivial solution
        <me>
          x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = \cdots = x_k = 0
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a set of vectors is not linearly independent,
        then the set is <term>linearly dependent</term>.
            <idx><h>linear dependent vectors in a vector space</h></idx>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    Alternatively, we say that the vectors
    <m>\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_k</m> are linearly independent
    (or dependent)
    if the set <m>\{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_k\}</m> is linearly independent
    (or dependent).

            We can use the tools we developed to determine if a set of vectors in <m>\R^n</m> is linearly independent to answer the same questions for sets of vectors in other vector spaces.
            For example, consider the question of whether the set
            <m>\{1+t, 1-t\}</m> in <m>\pol_1</m> is linearly independent or dependent.
            To answer this question we need to determine if there is a non-trivial solution to the equation
            <men xml:id="eq_PA_5_b_1">
              x_1 (1+t) + x_2(1-t) = 0
            </men>.
            Note that equation <xref ref="eq_PA_5_b_1"/> can also be written in the form
            <me>
              (x_1+x_2) + (x_1-x_2)t = 0
            </me>.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Recall that two polynomials are equal if all coefficients of like powers are the same.
                  By equating coefficients of like power terms,
                  rewrite equation <xref ref="eq_PA_5_b_1"/> as an equivalent system of two equations in the two unknowns <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m>,
                  and solve for <m>x_1, x_2</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  What does your answer to the previous part tell you about the linear independence or dependence of the set <m>\{1+t, 1-t\}</m> in <m>\pol_1</m>?
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Recall that in <m>\R^n</m>,
                  a set of two vectors is linearly dependent if and only if one of the vectors in the set is a scalar multiple of the other and linearly independent if neither vector is a scalar multiple of the other.
                  Verify your answer to part (c) from a similar perspective in <m>\pol_1</m>.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We can use the same type of method as in problem (1) to address the question of whether the set
            <me>
              \left\{ \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 1\amp 3 \\ 1\amp 2 \end{array}  \right], \left[ \begin{array}{cr} 1\amp -9 \\ 1\amp 8 \end{array}  \right], \left[ \begin{array}{cr} 1\amp -1 \\ 1\amp 4 \end{array}  \right] \right\}
            </me>
            is linearly independent or dependent in <m>\M_{2 \times 2}</m>.
            To answer this question we need to determine if there is a non-trivial solution to the equation
            <men xml:id="eq_PA_5_b_2">
              x_1\left[ \begin{array}{cc} 1\amp 3 \\ 1\amp 2 \end{array}  \right] + x_2\left[ \begin{array}{cr} 1\amp -9 \\ 1\amp 8 \end{array}  \right] + x_3 \left[ \begin{array}{cr} 1\amp -1 \\ 1\amp 4 \end{array}  \right] = \vzero
            </men>
            for some scalars <m>x_1</m>, <m>x_2</m>, and <m>x_3</m>.
            Note that the linear combination on the left side of equation <xref ref="eq_PA_5_b_2"/> has entries
            <me>
              \left[ \begin{array}{cc} x_1+x_2+x_3\amp 3x_1-9x_2-x_3 \\ x_1+x_2+x_3\amp 2x_1+8x_2+4x_3 \end{array}  \right]
            </me>.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Recall that two matrices are equal if all corresponding entries are the same.
                  Equate corresponding entries of the matrices in equation <xref ref="eq_PA_5_b_2"/> to rewrite the equation as an equivalent system of four equations in the three unknowns <m>x_1</m>,
                  <m>x_2</m>, and <m>x_3</m>.

                  <me>
                    \left\{ \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 1\amp 3 \\ 1\amp 2 \end{array}  \right], \left[ \begin{array}{cr} 1\amp -9 \\ 1\amp 8 \end{array}  \right], \left[ \begin{array}{cr} 1\amp -1 \\ 1\amp 4 \end{array}  \right] \right\}?

              <li>
                <p>
                  Recall that in <m>\R^n</m>,
                  a set of vectors is linearly dependent if and only if one of the vectors in the set is a linear combination of the others and linearly independent if no vector in the set is a linear combination of the others.

            We will define a basis for a vector space to be a linearly independent spanning set.
            Which, if any,
            of the sets in parts (1) and (2) is a basis for its vector space?
            Explain.
