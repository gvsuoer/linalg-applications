  <title>The Characteristic Equation</title>
  <p>
    Until now, we have been given eigenvalues or eigenvectors of a matrix and determined eigenvectors and eigenvalues from the known information.
    In this section we use determinants to find
    (or approximate)
    the eigenvalues of a matrix.
    From there we can find
    (or approximate)
    the corresponding eigenvectors.
    The tool we will use is a polynomial equation,
    the <temr>characteristic equation</temr>,
    of a square matrix whose roots are the eigenvalues of the matrix.
    The characteristic equation will then provide us with an <temr>algebraic</temr>
    way of finding the eigenvalues of a square matrix.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have seen that the eigenvalues of a square matrix <m>A</m> are the scalars <m>\lambda</m> so that
    <m>A - \lambda I</m> has a nontrivial null space.
    Since a matrix has a nontrivial null space if and only if the matrix is not invertible,
    we can also say that <m>\lambda</m> is an eigenvalue of <m>A</m> if
    <men xml:id="eq_4_b_1">
      \det(A - \lambda I) = 0
    </men>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that if <m>A</m> is an <m>n \times n</m> matrix,
    then <m>\det(A - \lambda I)</m> is a polynomial of degree <m>n</m>.
    Furthermore, if <m>A</m> has real entries,
    the polynomial has real coefficients.
    This polynomial,
    and the equation <xref ref="eq_4_b_1"/> are given special names.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <idx><h>characteristic polynomial</h></idx>
    <idx><h>characteristic equation</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be an <m>n \times n</m> matrix.
        The <term>characteristic polynomial</term> of <m>A</m> is the polynomial
        <me>
          \det(A-\lambda I_n)
        </me>,
        where <m>I_n</m> is the <m>n \times n</m> identity matrix.
        The <term>characteristic equation</term>
        of <m>A</m> is the equation
        <me>
          \det(A-\lambda I_n) = 0
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    So the characteristic equation of <m>A</m> gives us an algebraic way of finding the eigenvalues of <m>A</m>.

  <p>
    As we argued in <xref ref="pa_4_b"></xref>,
    a <m>2 \times 2</m> matrix can have at most 2 eigenvalues.
    For an <m>n \times n</m> matrix,
    the characteristic polynomial will be a degree <m>n</m> polynomial,
    and we know from algebra that a degree <m>n</m> polynomial can have at most <m>n</m> roots.
    Since an eigenvalue of a matrix is a root of the characteristic polynomial of that matrix,
    we can conclude that an <m>n \times n</m> matrix can have at most <m>n</m> distinct eigenvalues.
    <xref ref="act_4_b_1"></xref>
    (b) shows that a <m>4 \times 4</m> matrix may have fewer than <m>4</m> eigenvalues, however.
    Note that one of these eigenvalues,
    the eigenvalue 1, appears three times as a root of the characteristic polynomial of the matrix.
    The number of times an eigenvalue appears as a root of the characteristic polynomial is called the
    <term>(algebraic) multiplicity</term> of the eigenvalue.
    More formally:
  </p>

  <definition>
    <idx><h>multiplicity</h><h>algebraic</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The <term>(algebraic) multiplicity</term> of an eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m> of a matrix <m>A</m> is the largest integer <m>m</m> so that
        <m>(x-\lambda)^m</m> divides the characteristic polynomial of <m>A</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    Thus, in <xref ref="act_4_b_1"></xref>
    (b) the eigenvalue 1 has multiplicity 3 and the eigenvalue 2 has multiplicity 1.
    Notice that if we count the eigenvalues of an
    <m>n \times n</m> matrix with their multiplicities,
    the total will always be <m>n</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If <m>A</m> is a matrix with real entries,
    then the characteristic polynomial will have real coefficients.
    It is possible that the characteristic polynomial can have complex roots,
    and that the matrix <m>A</m> has complex eigenvalues.
    The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra shows us that if a real matrix has complex eigenvalues,
    then those eigenvalues will appear in conjugate pairs,
    i.e., if <m>\lambda_1=a+ib</m> is an eigenvalue of <m>A</m>,
    then <m>\lambda_2=a-ib</m> is another eigenvalue of <m>A</m>.
    Furthermore, for an odd degree polynomial,
    since the complex eigenvalues will come in conjugate pairs,
    we will be able to find at least one real eigenvalue.
  </p>
  <p>
    We now summarize the information we have so far about eigenvalues of an <m>n\times n</m> real matrix:
  </p>

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be an <m>n\times n</m> matrix with real entries.
        Then
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              There are at most <m>n</m> eigenvalues of <m>A</m>.
              If each eigenvalue
              (including complex eigenvalues)
              is counted with its multiplicity,
              there are exactly <m>n</m> eigenvalues.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>A</m> has a complex eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m>,
              the complex conjugate of <m>\lambda</m> is also an eigenvalue of <m>A</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>n</m> is odd, <m>A</m> has at least one real eigenvalue.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>A</m> is upper or lower-triangular,
              the eigenvalues are the entries on the diagonal.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
