  <title>The Characteristic Equation</title>
  <p>
    Until now, we have been given eigenvalues or eigenvectors of a matrix and determined eigenvectors and eigenvalues from the known information.
    In this section we use determinants to find
    (or approximate)
    the eigenvalues of a matrix.
    From there we can find
    (or approximate)
    the corresponding eigenvectors.
    The tool we will use is a polynomial equation,
    the <em>characteristic equation</em>,
    of a square matrix whose roots are the eigenvalues of the matrix.
    The characteristic equation will then provide us with an <em>algebraic</em>
    way of finding the eigenvalues of a square matrix.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have seen that the eigenvalues of a square matrix <m>A</m> are the scalars <m>\lambda</m> so that
    <m>A - \lambda I</m> has a nontrivial null space.
    Since a matrix has a nontrivial null space if and only if the matrix is not invertible,
    we can also say that <m>\lambda</m> is an eigenvalue of <m>A</m> if
    <men xml:id="eq_4_b_1">
      \det(A - \lambda I) = 0
    </men>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that if <m>A</m> is an <m>n \times n</m> matrix,
    then <m>\det(A - \lambda I)</m> is a polynomial of degree <m>n</m>.
    Furthermore, if <m>A</m> has real entries,
    the polynomial has real coefficients.
    This polynomial,
    and the equation <xref ref="eq_4_b_1"/> are given special names.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be an <m>n \times n</m> matrix.
        The <term>characteristic polynomial</term><idx><h>characteristic polynomial</h></idx> of <m>A</m> is the polynomial
        <me>
          \det(A-\lambda I_n)
        </me>,
        where <m>I_n</m> is the <m>n \times n</m> identity matrix.
        The <term>characteristic equation</term>
            <idx><h>characteristic equation</h></idx>
        of <m>A</m> is the equation
        <me>
          \det(A-\lambda I_n) = 0
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    So the characteristic equation of <m>A</m> gives us an algebraic way of finding the eigenvalues of <m>A</m>.

    As we argued in Preview <xref ref="pa_4_b">Activity</xref>,
    a <m>2 \times 2</m> matrix can have at most 2 eigenvalues.
    For an <m>n \times n</m> matrix,
    the characteristic polynomial will be a degree <m>n</m> polynomial,
    and we know from algebra that a degree <m>n</m> polynomial can have at most <m>n</m> roots.
    Since an eigenvalue of a matrix is a root of the characteristic polynomial of that matrix,
    we can conclude that an <m>n \times n</m> matrix can have at most <m>n</m> distinct eigenvalues.
    <xref ref="act_4_b_1">Activity</xref>
    (b) shows that a <m>4 \times 4</m> matrix may have fewer than <m>4</m> eigenvalues, however.
    Note that one of these eigenvalues,
    the eigenvalue 1, appears three times as a root of the characteristic polynomial of the matrix.
    The number of times an eigenvalue appears as a root of the characteristic polynomial is called the
    <em>(algebraic) multiplicity</em> of the eigenvalue.
    More formally:
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The <term>(algebraic) multiplicity</term><idx><h>multiplicity</h><h>algebraic</h></idx> of an eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m> of a matrix <m>A</m> is the largest integer <m>m</m> so that
        <m>(x-\lambda)^m</m> divides the characteristic polynomial of <m>A</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    Thus, in <xref ref="act_4_b_1">Activity</xref>
    (b) the eigenvalue 1 has multiplicity 3 and the eigenvalue 2 has multiplicity 1.
    Notice that if we count the eigenvalues of an
    <m>n \times n</m> matrix with their multiplicities,
    the total will always be <m>n</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If <m>A</m> is a matrix with real entries,
    then the characteristic polynomial will have real coefficients.
    It is possible that the characteristic polynomial can have complex roots,
    and that the matrix <m>A</m> has complex eigenvalues.
    The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra shows us that if a real matrix has complex eigenvalues,
    then those eigenvalues will appear in conjugate pairs,
    i.e., if <m>\lambda_1=a+ib</m> is an eigenvalue of <m>A</m>,
    then <m>\lambda_2=a-ib</m> is another eigenvalue of <m>A</m>.
    Furthermore, for an odd degree polynomial,
    since the complex eigenvalues will come in conjugate pairs,
    we will be able to find at least one real eigenvalue.

    We now summarize the information we have so far about eigenvalues of an <m>n\times n</m> real matrix:
  </p>
  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be an <m>n\times n</m> matrix with real entries.
        Then
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              There are at most <m>n</m> eigenvalues of <m>A</m>.
              If each eigenvalue
              (including complex eigenvalues)
              is counted with its multiplicity,
              there are exactly <m>n</m> eigenvalues.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>A</m> has a complex eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m>,
              the complex conjugate of <m>\lambda</m> is also an eigenvalue of <m>A</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>n</m> is odd, <m>A</m> has at least one real eigenvalue.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>A</m> is upper or lower-triangular,
              the eigenvalues are the entries on the diagonal.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
