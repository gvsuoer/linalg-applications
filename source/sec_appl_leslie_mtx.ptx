  <title>Application: Leslie Matrices and Population Modeling</title>
  <p>
    The Leslie Matrix
    (also called the Leslie Model)
    is a powerful model for describing an age distributed growth of a population that is closed to migration.
    In a Leslie model, it is usually the case that only one gender
    (most often female)
    is considered.
    As an example,
    we will later consider a population of sheep that is being grown commercially.
    A natural question that we will address is how we can harvest the population to build a sustainable environment.

    When working with populations,
    the matrices we use are often large.
    For large matrices,
    using the characteristic polynomial to calculate eigenvalues is too time and resource consuming to be practical,
    and we generally cannot find the exact values of the eigenvalues.
    As a result, approximation techniques are very important.
    In this section we will explore a method for approximating eigenvalues.
    The eigenvalues of a Leslie matrix are important because they describe the limiting or steady-state behavior of a population.
    The matrix and model were introduced by Patrick H. Leslie in
    <q>On the Use of Matrices in Certain Population Mathematics</q>, Leslie, P.H., <em>Biometrika</em>, Volume XXXIII, November 1945, pp. 183-212.
