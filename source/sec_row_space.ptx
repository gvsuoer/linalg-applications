  <title>The Row Space of a Matrix</title>
  <p>
    As you might expect,
    if there is a column space for a matrix then there is also a row space for a matrix.
    The row space is defined just as the column space as the span of the rows of a matrix.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The <term>row space</term>
            <idx><h>row space</h></idx>
        of an <m>m \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> is the span of the row of <m>A</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    There is really nothing new here, though.
    Since the rows of <m>A</m> are the columns of <m>A^{\tr}</m>,
    it follows that <m>\Row A = \Col A^{\tr}</m>.
    So if we want to learn anything about the row space of <m>A</m>,
    we can just translate all of our questions to the column space of <m>A^{\tr}</m>.
