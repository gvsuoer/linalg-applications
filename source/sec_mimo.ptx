  <title>Application: MIMO Systems</title>
  <p>
    MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) systems are widely used to increase data transmission rates and improve the quality of wireless communication systems.
    MIMO is one of several forms of smart antenna technology,
    and it makes use of multiple antennas at the transmitter to send signals and multiple antennas at the receiver to accept the signals.
    MIMO systems transmit the same data on multiple streams,
    which introduces redundancy into the system.
    MIMO systems can utilize bounced and reflected signals to actually improve signal strength.
    This is very useful in urban environments in the presence of large buildings and the absence of direct line-of-sight transmission.
    MIMO systems can transmit several information streams in parallel
    (known as spatial multiplexing),
    allowing for increased data transformation rates.
    The presence of multiple receiver antennas allows for greater reliability in the system.

    In a MIMO system,
    every transmitter antenna sends a signal to every receiver antenna as illustrated in <xref ref="F_MIMO"></xref>.
    In each of these transmissions the signal can be disturbed in some way.
    Two types of disturbances are <em>fading</em> and <em>noise</em>.
    Fading is due to time variations in the received signal,
    which can occur because of atmospheric conditions or obstacles over the path which are varying with respect to time.
    In a MIMO system we have <em>multipath fading</em>
    for the different paths the signal takes from different antennas to receivers,
    which causes fluctuations in amplitude,
    phase and angle of arrival of the received signal.
    Noise is an unwanted signal which interferes with actual signal.
    Both fading and noise result in a received signal that is different than the transmitted signal.
    The problem is how to recover the original signal from the transmitted signal.
    The QR decomposition is used in this process.
    To improve the efficiency of MIMO systems,
    different methods are introduced to determine a QR decomposition.
    We will discuss MIMO systems in more detail later in this section,
    and how Householder transformations can be used to find QR decompositions.
