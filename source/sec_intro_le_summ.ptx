    In this section we introduced linear equations and systems of linear equations.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Informally, a linear equation is an equation in which each term is either a constant or a 
          constant times a variable.
          More formally,
          a linear equation in the variables <m>x_1</m>, <m>x_2</m>,
          <m>\ldots</m>, <m>x_n</m> is an equation of the form
          <me>
            a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \cdots + a_nx_n = b
          </me>,
          where <m>n</m> is a positive integer and <m>a_1</m>, <m>a_2</m>,
          <m>\ldots</m>, <m>a_n</m> and <m>b</m> are constants.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A system of linear equations is a collection of one or more linear equations in the same 
          variables.
        </p>

          Informally, a solution to a system of linear equations is a point that satisfies all of 
          the equations in the system.
          More formally,
          a solution to a system of linear equation in <m>n</m> variables <m>x_1</m>,
          <m>x_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
          <m>x_n</m> is an ordered <m>n</m>-tuple
          <m>(s_1, s_2, \ldots,
          s_n)</m> of numbers so that we obtain all true statements in the system when we replace 
          <m>x_1</m> with <m>s_1</m>,
          <m>x_2</m> with <m>s_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
          and <m>x_n</m> with <m>s_n</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Two linear systems are equivalent if they have the same solution set.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The following operations on a system of equations do not change the solution set:
          <ol marker="(1)">
            <li>
              <p>
                Replace one equation by the sum of that equation and a scalar multiple of another 
                equation.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Interchange two equations.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Replace an equation by a nonzero scalar multiple of itself.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
