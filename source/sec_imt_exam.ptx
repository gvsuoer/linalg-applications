  <example>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Let <m>M = \left[ \begin{array}{cccc} 1\amp 2\amp 2\amp 1 \\ 0\amp 1\amp 0\amp 1 \\ 1\amp 3\amp 2\amp 3 \\ 0\amp 1\amp 0\amp 0 \end{array} \right]</m>.

        <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Without doing any calculations, is <m>M</m> invertible?
              Explain your response.
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              The third column of <m>M</m> is twice the first,
              so the columns of <m>M</m> are not linearly independent.
              We conclude that <m>M</m> is not invertible.

          <statement>
            <p>
              Is the equation <m>M \vx = \vb</m> consistent for every <m>\vb</m> in <m>\R^4</m>?
              Explain.
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              The equation <m>M \vx = \vb</m> is not consistent for every <m>\vb</m> in <m>\R^4</m>.
              If it was, then the columns of <m>M</m> would span <m>\R^4</m> and,
              since there are exactly four columns,
              the columns of <m>M</m> would be a basis for <m>\R^4</m>.
              Thus, <m>M</m> would have to be invertible, which it is not.

        <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Is the equation <m>M \vx = \vzero</m> consistent?
              If so, how many solutions does this equation have?
              Explain.
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              The homogeneous system is always consistent.
              Since the columns of <m>M</m> are linearly dependent,
              the equation <m>M \vx = \vzero</m> has infinitely many solutions.

          <statement>
            <p>
              Is it possible to find a <m>4 \times 4</m> matrix <m>P</m> such that <m>PM = I_4</m>?
              Explain.
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              It is not possible to find a
              <m>4 \times 4</m> matrix <m>P</m> such that <m>PM = I_4</m>.
              Otherwise <m>M</m> would have to be invertible.

  <example>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Let <m>M</m> be an <m>n \times n</m> matrix whose eigenvalues are all nonzero.
      </p>
    </introduction>
        <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Let <m>\vb \in \R^n</m>.
              Is the equation <m>M \vx = \vb</m> consistent?
              If yes, explain why and find all solutions in terms of <m>M</m> and <m>\vb</m>.
              If no, explain why.
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              Since <m>0</m> is not an eigenvalue of <m>M</m>,
              we know that <m>M</m> is invertible.
              Therefore, the equation <m>M \vx = \vb</m> has the unique solution <m>\vx = M^{-1} \vb</m>.
            </p>
          </solution>

        <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Let <m>S</m> be the matrix transformation defined by <m>S(\vx) = M\vx</m>.
              Suppose <m>S(\va) = S(\vb)</m> for some vectors <m>\va</m> and <m>\vb</m> in <m>\R^n</m>.
              Must there be any relationship between <m>\va</m> and <m>\vb</m>?
              If yes, explain the relationship.
              If no, explain why.
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              The fact that <m>M</m> is invertible implies that <m>S</m> is one-to-one.
              So if <m>S(\va) = S(\vb)</m>,
              then it must be the case that <m>\va = \vb</m>.
            </p>
          </solution>

        <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Let <m>\vm_1</m>, <m>\vm_2</m>,
              <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\vm_n</m> be the columns of <m>M</m>.
              In how many ways can we write the zero vector as a linear combination of <m>\vm_1</m>,
              <m>\vm_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\vm_n</m>?
              Explain.
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              Because <m>M</m> is invertible,
              the columns of <m>M</m> are linearly independent.
              Therefore, there is only the trivial solution to the equation
              <me>
                x_1\vm_1 + x_2\vm_2 +  \cdots + x_n\vm_n = \vzero
              </me>.
