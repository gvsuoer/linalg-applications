    <introduction>
      <p>
        Find a Jordan form <m>J</m> for each of the following matrices.
        Find a matrix <m>C</m> such that <m>C^{-1}AC = J</m>.
      </p>
    </introduction>
        <task>
          
          <statement>
            <p>
              <m>A = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 1\amp 1\\1\amp 1 \end{array} \right]</m>  
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              The eigenvalues of <m>A</m> are <m>2</m> and <m>0</m> with corresponding eigenvectors
        <m>[1 \ 1]^{\tr}</m> and <m>[-1 \ 1]^{\tr}</m>.
        Since we have a basis for <m>\R^2</m> consisting of eigenvectors for <m>A</m>,
        we know that <m>A</m> is diagonalizable.
        Moreover, Jordan canonical form of <m>A</m> is
        <m>J = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 2\amp 0\\0\amp 0 \end{array} \right]</m> and <m>C^{-1}AC = J</m>,
        where <m>C = \left[ \begin{array}{cr} 1\amp -1\\1\amp 1 \end{array} \right]</m>.
            </p>
          </solution>
        </task>
        <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              <m>A = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} 0\amp 1\amp 1\\0\amp 0\amp 0 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 0 \end{array} \right]</m>  
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              Since <m>A</m> is upper triangular,
        its eigenvalues are the diagonal entries.
        So the only eigenvalue of <m>A</m> is 0, and technology shows that this eigenvalue has geometric multiplicity 2.
        An eigenvector for <m>A</m> is <m>\vv_1 = [1 \ 0 \ 0]^{\tr}</m>.
        A vector <m>\vv_2</m> that satisfies
        <m>A \vv_2 = \vv_1</m> is <m>\vv_2 = [0 \ 0 \ 1]^{\tr}</m>.
        Letting <m>C = \left[ \begin{array}{ccr} 1\amp 0\amp 0\\0\amp 0\amp -1\\0\amp 1\amp 1 \end{array}  \right]</m> gives us
        <me>
          \C^{-1}AC = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} 0\amp 1\amp 0 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 0 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 0 \end{array}  \right]
        </me>.
            </p>
          </solution>
        </task>
        <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              <m>A = \left[ \begin{array}{cccc} 1\amp 1\amp 1\amp 1\\0\amp 1\amp 0\amp 0\\0\amp 0\amp 2\amp 2 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 2 \end{array} \right]</m> 
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              Again, <m>A</m> is upper triangular,
        so the eigenvalues of <m>A</m> are <m>2</m> and <m>1</m>,
        both of algebraic multiplicity 2 and geometric multiplicity 1.
        Technology shows that the reduced row echelon forms of
        <m>A - 2I_4</m> and <m>(A-2I_4)^2</m> are
        <me>
          \left[ \begin{array}{ccrc} 1\amp 0\amp -1\amp 0 \\ 0\amp 1\amp 0\amp 0 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 1 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0 \end{array}  \right] \ \text{ and }  \ \left[ \begin{array}{ccrc} 1\amp 0\amp -1\amp 1 \\ 0\amp 1\amp 0\amp 0 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0 \end{array}  \right]
        </me>.
        Now <m>\vv_2 = [-1 \ 0 \ 0 \ 1]^{\tr}</m> is in <m>\Nul (A-2I_4)^2</m>, and
        <me>
          \vv_1 = (A-2I_4)\vv_2 = [2 \ 0 \ 2 \ 0]^{\tr}
        </me>.
        Notice that  Let <m>\vv_1</m> is an eigenvector of <m>A</m> with eigenvalue <m>2</m>.
        Technology also shows that the reduced row echelon forms of <m>A-I_4</m> and <m>(A-I_4)^2</m> are
        <me>
          \left[ \begin{array}{cccc} 0\amp 1\amp 0\amp 0 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 1\amp 0 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 1 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0 \end{array}  \right] \ \text{ and }  \ \left[ \begin{array}{cccc} 0\amp 0\amp 1\amp 0 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 1 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0 \end{array}  \right]
        </me>.
        Now <m>\vv_4 = [0 \ 1 \ 0 \ 0]^{\tr}</m> is in <m>\Nul (A-I_4)^2</m>, and
        <me>
          \vv_3 = (A-I_4)\vv_4 = [1 \ 0 \ 0 \ 0]^{\tr}
        </me>.
        Notice that  Let <m>\vv_3</m> is an eigenvector of <m>A</m> with eigenvalue <m>1</m>.
        Letting <m>C = \left[ \begin{array}{crcc} 2\amp -1\amp 1\amp 0 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 1 \\ 2\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0 \\ 0\amp 1\amp 0\amp 0 \end{array}  \right]</m> gives us
        <me>
          C^{-1}AC = \left[ \begin{array}{cccc} 2\amp 1\amp 0\amp 0 \\ 0\amp 2\amp 0\amp 0 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 1\amp 1 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 1 \end{array}  \right]
        </me>.

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>T(\vx) = A\vx</m>,
        where <m>A = \left[ \begin{array}{crc} 0\amp 1\amp 1 \\ 0\amp 1\amp 2 \\ 1\amp -1\amp 2 \end{array} \right]</m>.
        Assume that <m>P^{-1}AP = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} 1\amp 1\amp 0 \\ 0\amp 1\amp 1 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 1 \end{array} \right]</m>,
        where <m>P = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} 1\amp 0\amp 4 \\ 0\amp 2\amp 4 \\ 1\amp 2\amp 0 \end{array} \right]</m>.
        Find a specific coordinate system in which it is possible to succinctly describe the action of <m>T</m>,
        then describe the action of <m>T</m> on <m>\R^3</m> in as much detail as possible.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
    
  <p>
    First note that <m>1</m> is the only eigenvalue of <m>A</m>.
    Since <m>A</m> does not have <m>0</m> as an eigenvalue,
    it follows that <m>A</m> is invertible and so <m>T</m> is both one-to-one and onto.
    Let <m>\vv_1 = [4 \ 4 \ 0]^{\tr}</m>,
    <m>\vv_2 = [0 \ 2 \ 2]^{\tr}</m>,
    and <m>\vv_3 = [1 \ 0 \ 1]^{\tr}</m>.
    We have that
    <md>
      <mrow>(A-I_3)\vv_3 \amp = \vv_2</mrow>
      <mrow>(A-I_3)\vv_2 \amp = \vv_1</mrow>
      <mrow>(A-I_3) \vv_1 \amp = \vzero</mrow>
    </md>.
    and so
    <md>
      <mrow>T(\vv_3) \amp = A \vv_3 = \vv_3+\vv_2</mrow>
      <mrow>T(\vv_2) \amp = A \vv_2 = \vv_2+\vv_1</mrow>
      <mrow>T(\vv_1) \amp = A\vv_1 = \vv_1</mrow>
    </md>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we consider the coordinate system in <m>\R^3</m> defined by the basis
    <m>\{\vv_1, \vv_2, \vv_3\}</m> as shown in blue in <xref ref="F_JCF_example_3_d"></xref>,
    the fact that <m>T(\vv_1) = \vv_1</m> shows that <m>T</m> fixes all vectors in <m>\Span\{\vv_1\}</m>.
    That <m>T(\vv_2) = \vv_2+\vv_1</m> tells us that <m>T</m> maps
    <m>\Span\{\vv_2\}</m> onto <m>\Span\{\vv_1+\vv_2\}</m>,
    and <m>T(\vv_3) = \vv_3+\vv_2</m> shows that <m>T</m> maps
    <m>\Span\{\vv_3\}</m> onto <m>\Span\{\vv_2+\vv_3\}</m>.
    So <m>T</m> sends the box defined by <m>\vv_1</m>, <m>\vv_2</m>,
    and <m>\vv_3</m> onto the box defined by <m>\vv_1</m>,
    <m>\vv_1+\vv_2</m>,
    and <m>\vv_2+\vv_3</m> (in red in <xref ref="F_JCF_example_3_d"></xref>.
    So the action of <m>T</m> is conveniently viewed in the coordinate system determined by the columns of a matrix <m>P</m> that converts <m>A</m> into its Jordan canonical form.
