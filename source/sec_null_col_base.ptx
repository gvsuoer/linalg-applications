  <title>Bases for <m>\Nul A</m> and <m>\Col A</m></title>
  <p>
    When confronted with a subspace of <m>\R^n</m>,
    we will usually want to find a minimal spanning set <mdash/> a smallest spanning set <mdash/> for the space.
    Recall that a minimal spanning set is also called a basis for the space.
    So a basis for a space must span that space,
    and to be a minimal spanning set we have seen that a basis must also be linearly independent.
    So to prove that a set is a basis for a subspace of <m>\R^n</m> we need to demonstrate two things:
    that the set is linearly independent,
    and that the set spans the subspace.

  <p>
    You should have noticed that <xref ref="act_3_b_3"></xref>
    (a) provides a process for finding a basis for <m>\Col A</m> <mdash/> the pivot columns of <m>A</m> form a basis for <m>\Col A</m>.
    Similarly, <xref ref="act_3_b_3"></xref>
    (b) shows us that we can find a basis for <m>\Nul A</m> by writing the general solution to the homogeneous equation
    <m>A\vx = \vzero</m> as a linear combination of vectors whose weights are the variables corresponding to the non-pivot columns of <m>A</m> <mdash/> and these vectors form a basis for <m>\Nul A</m>.
    As we will argue next,
    these process always give us bases for <m>\Col A</m> and <m>\Nul A</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let <m>A</m> be an <m>m \times n</m> matrix,
    and let <m>R</m> be the reduced row echelon form of <m>A</m>.
    Suppose <m>R</m> has <m>k</m> non-pivot columns and <m>n-k</m> pivot columns.
    We can rearrange the columns so that the non-pivot columns of <m>R</m> are the last <m>k</m> columns
    (this just amounts to relabeling the unknowns in the system).
  </p>
    <paragraphs>
        <title>Basis for <m>\Nul A</m></title>
        <p>
          Here we argue that the method described following <xref ref="act_3_b_3"></xref>
          to find a spanning set for the null space always yields a basis for the null space.
          First note that <m>\Nul R = \Nul A</m>,
          since the system <m>A\vx = \vzero</m> has the same solution set as <m>R \vx = \vzero</m>.
          So it is enough to find a basis for <m>\Nul R</m>.
          If every column of <m>R</m> is a pivot column,
          then <m>R \vx = \vzero</m> has only the trivial solution and the null space of <m>R</m> is <m>\{ \vzero \}</m>.
          Let us now consider the case where <m>R</m> contains non-pivot columns.
          If we let <m>\vx = [x_1 \ x_2 \ \ldots \ x_n]^{\tr}</m>,
          and if <m>R\vx = \vzero</m> then we can write <m>x_1</m>,
          <m>x_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
          <m>x_{n-k}</m> in terms of <m>x_{n-k+1}</m>,
          <m>x_{n-k+2}</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, and <m>x_n</m>.
          From these equations we can write <m>\vx</m> as a linear combination of some vectors <m>\vv_1</m>,
          <m>\vv_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
          <m>\vv_k</m> with <m>x_{n-k+1}</m>,
          <m>x_{n-2+2}</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>x_n</m> as weights.
          By construction, each of the vectors <m>\vv_1</m>,
          <m>\vv_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
          <m>\vv_k</m> has a component that is 1 with the corresponding component as 0 in all the other <m>\vv_i</m>.
          Therefore, the vectors <m>\vv_1</m>, <m>\vv_2</m>,
          <m>\ldots</m>,
          <m>\vv_k</m> are linearly independent and span <m>\Nul R</m>
          (and <m>\Nul A</m>).
          In other words,
          the method we have developed to find the general solution to
          <m>A \vx = \vzero</m> always produces a basis for <m>\Nul A</m>.

      <paragraphs>
        <title>Basis for <m>\Col A</m></title>
        <p>
          Here we explain why the pivot columns of <m>A</m> form a basis for <m>\Col A</m>.
          Recall that the product <m>A \vx</m> expresses a linear combination of the columns of <m>A</m> with weights from <m>\vx</m>,
          and every such linear combination is matched with a product <m>R \vx</m> giving a linear combination of the columns of <m>R</m>
          <em>using the same weights</em>.
          So if a set of columns of <m>R</m> is linearly independent
          (or dependent),
          then the set of corresponding columns in <m>A</m> is linearly independent
          (or dependent)
          and vice versa.
          Since each pivot column of <m>R</m> is a vector with 1 in one entry (a different entry for different pivot columns) and zeros elsewhere,
          the pivot columns of <m>R</m> are clearly linearly independent.
          It follows that the pivot columns of <m>A</m> are linearly independent.
          All that remains is to explain why the pivot columns of <m>A</m> span <m>\Col A</m>.
          Let <m>\vr_1</m>, <m>\vr_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
          <m>\vr_n</m> be the columns of <m>R</m> so that <m>R~=~[\vr_1 \ \ \vr_2 \ \ \cdots \ \ \vr_n]</m>,
          and let <m>\va_1</m>, <m>\va_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
          <m>\va_n</m> be the columns of <m>A</m> so that <m>A~=~[\va_1 \ \ \va_2 \ \ \cdots \ \ \va_n]</m>.
          Suppose <m>\va_i</m> is a non-pivot column for <m>A</m> and <m>\vr_i</m> the corresponding non-pivot column in <m>R</m>.
          Each pivot column is composed of a single 1 with the rest of its entries 0.
          Also, if a non-pivot column contains a nonzero entry,
          then there is a corresponding pivot column that contains a 1 in the corresponding position.
          So <m>\vr_i</m> is a linear combination of <m>\vr_1</m>,
          <m>\vr_2</m>,
          <m>\ldots</m>,
          <m>\vr_{n-k}</m> <mdash/> the pivot columns of <m>R</m>.
          Thus,
          <me>
            \vr_i = c_1 \vr_1 + c_2\vr_2 + \cdots + c_{n-k}\vr_{n-k}
          </me>
          for some scalars <m>c_1</m>, <m>c_2</m>,
          <m>\ldots</m>, <m>c_{n-k}</m>.
          Let <m>\vx = [c_1 \ c_2 \ \cdots \ c_{n-k} \ 0 \ \cdots 0 \ -1 \ 0 \ \cdots \ 0]^{\tr}</m>,
          where the <m>-1</m> is in position <m>i</m>.
          Then <m>R \vx = \vzero</m> and so <m>A \vx = \vzero</m>.
          Thus,
          <me>
            \va_i = c_1 \va_1 + c_2\va_2 + \cdots + c_{n-k}\va_{n-k}
          </me>
          and <m>\va_i</m> is a linear combination of the pivot columns of <m>A</m>.
          So every non-pivot column of <m>A</m> is in the span of <m>A</m> and we conclude that the pivot columns of <m>A</m> form a basis for <m>\Col A</m>.

    It is the pivot columns of <m>A</m> that form a basis for <m>\Col A</m>,
    not the pivot columns of the reduced row echelon form <m>R</m> of <m>A</m>.
    In general, <m>\Col R \neq \Col A</m>.
