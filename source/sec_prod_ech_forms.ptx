  <title>Producing the Echelon Forms</title>
  <p>
    In this part,
    we consider the formal process of creating the row and reduced row echelon forms of matrices.
    The process of creating the row echelon form is the equivalent of the elimination method on 
    systems of linear equations.

    The complete process of applying row operations to reduce an augmented matrix to a row or reduced 
    row echelon form can be expressed as a recursive process in an algorithmic fashion,
    making it possible to program computers to solve linear systems.
    Here are the steps to do so:
    <dl>
      <li>
        <title>Step 1</title>
        <p>
          Begin with the leftmost nonzero column
          (if there is one).
          This will be a pivot column.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>Step 2</title>
        <p>
          Select a nonzero entry in this pivot column as a pivot.
          If necessary,
          interchange rows to move this entry to the first row
          (this entry will be a pivot).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>Step 3</title>
        <p>
          Use row operations to create zeros in all positions below the pivot.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>Step 4</title>
        <p>
          Cover (or ignore) the row containing the pivot position and cover all rows, if any,
          above it.
          Apply steps 1-3 to the submatrix that remains.
          Repeat the process until there are no more nonzero rows to modify.
        </p>
        <p>
          To obtain the reduced row echelon form we need one more step.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>Step 5</title>
        <p>
          Beginning with the rightmost pivot and working upward and to the left,
          create zeros above each pivot.
          If a pivot is not 1, make it 1 by an appropriate row multiplication.
        </p>
      </li>
    </dl>
  </p>

  <p>
    The algorithm described in steps 1-4 will produce the row echelon form of the matrix.
    This algorithm is called <term>Gaussian elimination</term>.
    When we add step 5 to produce the reduced row echelon form,
    the algorithm is called <term>Gauss-Jordan elimination</term>.

    <introduction>
    <p>
      Consider the matrix 
      <m>\left[ \begin{array}{rrcr} 0\amp 2\amp 4\amp 1\\ -1\amp 3\amp 0\amp 6 \\ 0\amp 4\amp 8\amp 2\\ 1\amp -3\amp 0\amp -2 \end{array} \right]</m>.
    </p>
    </introduction>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Perform Gaussian elimination to reduce the matrix to row echelon form.
            Clearly identify each step used.
            Compare your row echelon form to that of another group.
            Do your results agree?
            If not, who is right?

      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Now continue applying row operations to obtain the reduced row echelon form of the matrix.
            Clearly identify each step.
            Compare your row echelon form to that of another group.
            Do your results agree?

          </p>

      </task>

  <p>
    If we compare row echelon forms from <xref ref="act_1_c_3"></xref>,
    it is likely that different groups or individuals produced different row echelon forms.
    That is because the row echelon form of a matrix is not unique. (Is the row echelon form ever unique?)
  </p>
  <p>
    However, if row operations are applied correctly,
    then we will all arrive at the same reduced row echelon form in <xref ref="act_1_c_3"></xref>:
    <me>
      \left[ \begin{array}{cccc} 1\amp 0\amp 6\amp 0\\ 0\amp 1\amp 2\amp 0 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 1\\ 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0 \end{array}   \right]
    </me>.

    It turns out that the reduced row echelon form of a matrix is unique.
  </p>
  <p>
    Two matrices who are connected by row operations are said to be
    <term>row equivalent</term>.
  </p>

  <definition>
  <idx><h>row equivalent matrices</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A matrix <m>B</m> is <term>row equivalent</term>
        to a matrix <m>A</m> if <m>B</m> can be obtained by applying elementary row operations to <m>A</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    Since every elementary row operation is reversible,
    if <m>B</m> is row equivalent to <m>A</m>,
    then <m>A</m> is also row equivalent to <m>B</m>.
    Thus, we just say that <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are row equivalent.
    While the row echelon form of a matrix is not unique,
    it is the case that the reduced row echelon form of a matrix is unique.
  </p>

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Every matrix is row equivalent to a unique matrix in reduced row echelon form.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  
  <p>
    The reduced row echelon form of a matrix that corresponds to a system of linear equations 
    provides us with an equivalent system whose solutions are easy to find.
    As an example, consider the system
    <md alignment="alignat">
      <mrow> {}     \amp {}     \amp {2}x_2  \amp {}+{}  \amp {4}x_3  \amp {}+{}  \amp {}x_4  \amp {}={}  \amp  \ 0</mrow>
      <mrow>{-}x_1  \amp {}+{}  \amp {3}x_2  \amp {}    \amp {}    \amp {}+{}  \amp {6}x_4  \amp {}={}   \amp  \ 0</mrow>
      <mrow>{}      \amp {}    \amp {4}x_2  \amp {}+{}   \amp {8}x_3  \amp {}+{}  \amp {2}x_4  \amp {}={}   \amp  \ 0</mrow>
      <mrow>{}x_1  \amp {}-{}  \amp {3}x_2  \amp {}     \amp {}    \amp {}-{}  \amp {2}x_4  \amp {}={}   \amp  \ 0</mrow>
    </md>
    with augmented matrix
    <me>
      \left[ \begin{array}{rrcr|c} 0\amp 2\amp 4\amp 1\amp 0 \\ -1\amp 3\amp 0\amp 6\amp 0 \\ 0\amp 4\amp 8\amp 2\amp 0 \\ 1\amp -3\amp 0\amp -2\amp 0 \end{array}   \right]
    </me>.

    Notice that the coefficient matrix
    (the left hand side portion of the augmented matrix)
    of this system is same as the matrix we considered in <xref ref="act_1_c_3"></xref>.
    Since we are augmenting with a column of zeros,
    no row operations will change those zeros in the augmented column.
    So the row operations applied in <xref ref="act_1_c_3"></xref>
    will give us the reduced row echelon form of this augmented matrix as
    <me>
      \left[ \begin{array}{cccc|c} 1\amp 0\amp 6\amp 0\amp 0\\ 0\amp 1\amp 2\amp 0\amp 0 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 1\amp 0 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0 \end{array}  \right]
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that the third column is not a pivot column.
    That means that the variable <m>x_3</m> is a free variable.
    There are pivots in the other three columns of the coefficient matrix,
    so we can solve for <m>x_1</m>, <m>x_2</m>,
    and <m>x_4</m> in terms of <m>x_3</m>.
    These variables are the basic variables.
    The third row of the augmented matrix tells us that <m>x_4=0</m>.
    The second row corresponds to the equation <m>x_2+2x_3 = 0</m>,
    and solving for <m>x_2</m> shows that <m>x_2 = -2x_3</m>.
    Finally, the first row tells us that
    <m>x_1+6x_3 = 0</m>, so <m>x_1 = -6x_3</m>.
    Therefore, the general solution to this system of equations is
    <me>
      x_1 = -6x_3, \ \ \ \ x_2 = -2x_3, \ \ \ \ x_3 \text{ is free } , \ \ \ \  x_4 = 0
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The fact that <m>x_3</m> is free means that we can choose any value for <m>x_3</m> that we 
    like and obtain a specific solution to the system.
    For example, if <m>x_3=-1</m>,
    then we have the solution <m>x_1 = 6</m>,
    <m>x_2 = 2</m>, <m>x_3 = -1</m>, and <m>x_4 = 0</m>.
    Check this to be sure.

      Each matrix below is an augmented matrix for a linear system after elimination with 
      variables <m>x_1, x_2, \ldots</m> in that order.
      Identify the basic variables
      (if any)
      and free variables
      (if any).
      Then find the general solution
      (if there is a solution)

    Recall that in the previous section,
    we determined the criteria for when a system has a unique solution,
    or infinitely many solutions, or no solution.
    With the use of the row echelon form of the augmented matrix,
    we can rewrite these criteria as follows:
  </p>

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              A linear system is consistent if in the row echelon form of the augmented matrix 
              representing the system no pivot is in the rightmost column.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If a linear system is consistent and the row echelon form of the coefficient matrix 
              does not have a pivot in every column,
              then the system has infinitely many solutions.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If a linear system is consistent and there is a pivot in every column of the row 
              echelon form of the coefficient matrix,
              then the system has a unique solution.
            </p>
