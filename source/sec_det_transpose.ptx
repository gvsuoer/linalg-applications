  <title>The Determinant of the Transpose</title>
  <p>
    In this section we establish the fact that the determinant of a square matrix is the same as the determinant of its transpose.
  </p>
  <p>
    The result is easily verified for <m>2 \times 2</m> matrices,
    so we will proceed by induction and assume that the determinant of the transpose of any
    <m>(n-1) \times (n-1)</m> matrix is the same as the determinant of its transpose.
    Suppose <m>A = [a_{ij}]</m> is an <m>n \times n</m> matrix.
    By definition,
    <me>
      \det(A) = a_{11}C_{11} + a_{12}C_{12} + a_{13}C_{13} + \cdots + a_{1n}C_{1n}
    </me>
    and
    <me>
      \det(A^{\tr}) = a_{11}C_{11} + a_{21}C_{21} + a_{31}C_{31} + \cdots + a_{n1}C_{n1}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that the only terms in either determinant that contains <m>a_{11}</m> is <m>a_{11}C_{11}</m>.
    This term is the same in both determinants,
    so we proceed to examine other elements.
    Let us consider all terms in the cofactor expansion for
    <m>\det(A^{\tr})</m> that contain <m>a_{i1}a_{1j}</m>.
    The only summand that contains <m>a_{i1}</m> is <m>a_{i1}C_{i1}</m>.
    Letting <m>A_{ij}</m> be the sub-matrix of <m>A</m> obtained by deleting the <m>i</m>th row and <m>j</m>th column,
    we see that <m>a_{i1}C_{i1} = (-1)^{i+1}a_{i1}\det(A_{i1})</m>.
    Now let's examine the sub-matrix <m>A_{i1}</m>:

    <!-- Note: \rowcolor and \columncolor will likely not work well in LaTeX/PDF so stick with more -->

      \left[ \begin{array}{ccccccc} \cellcolor[gray]{.9} a_{12} \amp \cellcolor[gray]{.9} a_{13} \amp  \cellcolor[gray]{.9} \cdots    \amp \cellcolor[gray]{.9} a_{1j} \amp \cellcolor[gray]{.9} \cdots \amp \cellcolor[gray]{.9} a_{1n-1} \amp \cellcolor[gray]{.9} a_{1n} \\ a_{22} \amp  a_{23} \amp  \cdots    \amp \cellcolor[gray]{.9} a_{2j} \amp \cdots \amp  a_{2n-1} \amp  a_{2n} \\ \vdots \amp        \amp  \ddots    \amp \cellcolor[gray]{.9} \vdots          \amp \ddots \amp  \amp  \\ a_{i-12} \amp  a_{i-13} \amp  \cdots   \amp  \cellcolor[gray]{.9} a_{i-1j} \amp \cdots \amp  a_{i-1n-1} \amp  a_{i-1n} \\ a_{i+12} \amp  a_{i+13} \amp  \cdots    \amp \cellcolor[gray]{.9} a_{i+1j} \amp \cdots \amp  a_{i+1n-1} \amp  a_{i+1n} \\ a_{n2} \amp  a_{n3} \amp  \cdots    \amp \cellcolor[gray]{.9} a_{nj} \amp \cdots \amp  a_{nn-1} \amp  a_{nn} \end{array}  \right]
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    When we expand along the first row to calculate <m>\det(A_{i1})</m>,
    the only term that will involve <m>a_{1j}</m> is
    <me>
      (-1)^{j-1+1}a_{1j}\det(A_{i1, 1j})
    </me>,
    where <m>A_{ik,jm}</m> denotes the sub-matrix of <m>A</m> obtained by deleting rows <m>i</m> and <m>k</m> and columns <m>j</m> and <m>m</m> from <m>A</m>.
    So the term that contains <m>a_{i1}a_{1j}</m> in the cofactor expansion for <m>\det(A^{\tr})</m> is
    <men xml:id="eq_det_transpose_1">
      (-1){i+1}a_{i1}(-1)^{j}a_{1j}\det(A_{i1_{1j}}) = (-1)^{i+j+1} a_{i1}a_{1j}\det(A_{i1, 1j})
    </men>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now we examine the cofactor expansion for <m>\det(A)</m> to find the terms that contain <m>a_{i1}a_{1j}</m>.
    The quantity <m>a_{1j}</m> only appears in the cofactor expansion as
    <me>
      a_{1j}C_{1j} = (-1)^{1+j}a_{1j}\det(A_{1j})
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now let's examine the sub-matrix <m>A_{1j}</m>:
    <!-- Shading for arrays: use \cellcolor[gray]{.9} after the \amp of each cell you want shaded. -->
    <!-- Note: \rowcolor and \columncolor will likely not work well in LaTeX/PDF so stick with more -->
    <!-- labor-intensive \cellcolor -->
    <me>
      \left[ \begin{array}{ccccccc} \cellcolor[gray]{.9} a_{21}   \amp  a_{22}   \amp  \cdots    \amp a_{2j-1} \amp a_{2j+1} \amp \cdots \amp  a_{2n} \\ \cellcolor[gray]{.9} a_{31}   \amp  a_{32}   \amp  \cdots    \amp a_{3j-1} \amp a_{3j+1} \amp \cdots \amp  a_{3n} \\ \cellcolor[gray]{.9} \vdots   \amp            \amp  \ddots    \amp  \vdots   \amp \ddots    \amp       \amp  \\  \cellcolor[gray]{.9} a_{i1}   \amp \cellcolor[gray]{.9} a_{i2}   \amp \cellcolor[gray]{.9} \cdots     \amp \cellcolor[gray]{.9} a_{ij-1} \amp \cellcolor[gray]{.9} a_{ij+1}   \amp \cellcolor[gray]{.9} \cdots \amp \cellcolor[gray]{.9} a_{in} \\ \cellcolor[gray]{.9} \vdots   \amp            \amp             \amp  \vdots   \amp          \amp \vdots \amp \\ \cellcolor[gray]{.9} a_{n1}   \amp  a_{n2}   \amp  \cdots    \amp a_{nj-1} \amp a_{nj+1}  \amp \cdots \amp  a_{nn} \end{array}  \right]
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Here is where we use the induction hypothesis.
    Since <m>A_{1j}</m> is an <m>(n-1) \times (n-1)</m> matrix,
    its determinant can be found with a cofactor expansion down the first column.
    The only term in this cofactor expansion that will involve <m>a_{i1}</m> is
    <me>
      (-1)^{i-1+1}a_{i1} \det(A_{1i, j1})
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    So the term that contains <m>a_{i1}a_{1j}</m> in the cofactor expansion for <m>\det(A)</m> is
    <men xml:id="eq_det_transpose_2">
      (-1)^{1+j}a_{1j}(-1)^{i-1+1}a_{i1} \det(A_{1j_{i1}}) = (-1)^{i+j+1} a_{i1}a_{1j}\det(A_{1i, j1})
    </men>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since the quantities in <xref ref="eq_det_transpose_1"/> and <xref ref="eq_det_transpose_2"/> are equal,
    we conclude that the terms in the two cofactor expansions are the same and
    <me>
      \det(A^{\tr}) = \det(A)
    </me>.
