  <title>Application: The Multivariable Second Derivative Test</title>
  <p>
    In single variable calculus,
    we learn that the second derivative can be used to classify a critical point of the type where the derivative of a function is 0 as a local maximum or minimum.
  </p>
  <theorem>
    <title>The Second Derivative Test for Single-Variable Functions</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>a</m> is a critical number of a function <m>f</m> so that <m>f'(a)=0</m> and if <m>f''(a)</m> exists, then
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              if <m>f''(a) \lt 0</m>,
              then <m>f(a)</m> is a local maximum value of <m>f</m>,
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              if <m>f''(a) > 0</m>,
              then <m>f(a)</m> is a local minimum value of <m>f</m>, and
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              if <m>f''(a) = 0</m>, this test yields no information.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    In the two-variable case we have an analogous test,
    which is usually seen in a multivariable calculus course.
  </p>

  <theorem>
    <title>The Second Derivative Test for Functions of Two Variables</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>(a,b)</m> is a critical point of the function <m>f</m> for which
        <m>f_x(a,b) = 0</m> and <m>f_y(a,b) = 0</m>.
        Let <m>D</m> be the quantity defined by
        <me>
          D = f_{xx}(a,b) f_{yy}(a,b) - f_{xy}(a,b)^2
        </me>.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>D>0</m> and <m>f_{xx}(a,b) \lt 0</m>,
              then <m>f</m> has a local maximum at <m>(a,b)</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>D>0</m> and <m>f_{xx}(a,b) > 0</m>,
              then <m>f</m> has a local minimum at <m>(a,b)</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>D \lt 0</m>, then <m>f</m> has a saddle point at <m>(a,b)</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>D = 0</m>,
              then this test yields no information about what happens at <m>(a,b)</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  
  <p>
    A proof of this test for two-variable functions is based on Taylor polynomials,
    and relies on symmetric matrices,
    eigenvalues, and quadratic forms.
    The steps for a proof will be found later in this section.
