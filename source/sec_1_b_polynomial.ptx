  <title>Project: Polynomial Interpolation to Approximate the Area Under a Curve</title>
  <p>
    Suppose we want to approximate the area of the region shown in <xref ref="F_1_b_area"></xref>.
    As discussed in the introduction,
    we can approximate the area under a curve by approximating the curve by quadratics.
    First, we will see how Archimedes approached the problem of finding the area of a quadratic region,
    then we will determine how to determine a quadratic function that passes through three points,
    then we put it all together to approximate the area under a curve as in <xref ref="F_1_b_area"></xref>.

  <p>
    Archimedes approached the problem of calculating the area of a quadratic region in the following way.
    Given a quadratic <m>q(x)</m> on an interval <m>[a,b]</m>, Archimedes drew in a base given by the 
    secant line connecting the points <m>(a,q(a))</m> and
    <m>(b,q(b))</m> as illustrated at left in <xref ref="F_1_b_Archimedes"></xref>.
    Then he found the point in the interval <m>[a,b]</m> at which the tangent line to the curve is 
    parallel to the secant line.
    Archimedes gave an argument using mechanics
    (based on balance points),
    and then another using geometry
    (through a method of exhaustion)
    to show that the area of the parabolic region is
    <m>\frac{4}{3}</m> times the area of the triangle determined by the endpoints and the point of tangency as shown at right in <xref ref="F_1_b_Archimedes"></xref>.

  <p>
    Although we won't go through the details,
    a conclusion we can draw from Archimedes argument,
    using the formula for the area of a rectangle and the area of a triangle,
    is that the area between the graph of a quadratic with equation
    <m>q(x) = ax^2+bx+c</m> and the <m>x</m>-axis on an interval
    <m>[x_1, x_2]</m> as illustrated in <xref ref="F_1_b_quad_area"></xref> is
    <men xml:id="eq_quad_area">
      \frac{a}{3}(x_2^3-x_1^3) + \frac{b}{2}(x_2^2-x_1^2) + c(x_2-x_1)
    </men>.

    <caption>Region between a parabola and the <m>x</m>-axis.</caption>
    <image width="30%" source="1_b_quad_area"/>
  </figure>

  <p>
    To approximate the area under the graph of a function,
    we will approximate the function itself with a collection of quadratics,
    and then use equation <xref ref="eq_quad_area"/> repeatedly.
    To do this, we need to know how to fit a quadratic curve to a three points.
    We consider that question now.
  </p>
  <p>
  <idx><h>polynomial curve fitting</h></idx>
    Suppose we are given a collection of three points in the plane:
    <m>(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)</m> and <m>(x_3, y_3)</m>.
    There is exactly one quadratic polynomial <m>p(x)</m> which goes through these points,
    i.e. there is exactly one quadratic <m>p(x)</m> such that for each <m>x_i</m>,
    <m>p(x_i)=y_i</m>.
    This is an example of <term>polynomial curve fitting</term>.
        
  </p>
  <p>
    As an example, we use the points <m>(-1, 2)</m>,
    <m>(1,6)</m>, <m>(2,5)</m>.
    To fit a quadratic to these points,
    consider a general quadratic of the form <m>p(x)=a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0</m>.
    By substituting the <m>x</m> value of each of the given points and setting that equal to the <m>y</m> value of that point,
    we find three equations
    <me>
      (-1)^2a_2-a_1+a_0=2 \; , \;  a_2+a_1+a_0=6 \; , \;  (2)^2a_2 +2a_1+a_0=5
    </me>
    that give us a system of three equations in the three unknowns <m>a_2</m>,
    <m>a_1</m>, and <m>a_0</m>:
    <md alignment="alignat">
      <mrow> {}a_2  \amp {}-{}   \amp {}a_1   \amp {}+{}  \amp {}a_0   \amp = 2</mrow>
      <mrow>{}a_2   \amp {}+{}  \amp {}a_1   \amp {}+{}  \amp {}a_0  \amp = 6</mrow>
      <mrow>a_2  \amp {}+{}   \amp {2}a_1  \amp {}+{}   \amp {}a_0   \amp = 5</mrow>
    </md>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This system is the example we considered in <xref ref="pa_1_b"></xref>,
    whose solution is <m>a_2 = -1</m>,
    <m>a_1=2</m>, and <m>a_0 = 5</m>.
    A graph of <m>q(x) = -x^2+2x+5</m> along with the three points <m>(-1, 2)</m>,
    <m>(1,6)</m>,
    <m>(2,5)</m> is shown in <xref ref="F_1_b_quadratic_fit"></xref>.
  </p>

  </figure>

  <p>
    Now that we know how to fit a quadratic to three points,
    we next approximate a curve with a collection of quadratics.
    The method we use is to break the interval on which our curve is defined into several subintervals and create quadratics on each subinterval.
    The basic idea is contained in our first project activity.

    <introduction>
    <p>
      In this activity we model the function <m>f</m> defined by
      <m>f(x) = \sin(2x)+2</m> on the interval <m>[a,b]</m>,
      where <m>a = -\frac{\pi}{2}</m> and <m>b = \pi</m> with a collection of quadratics.
      Let <m>f(x) = \sin(x)</m>.
      We divide the interval <m>[a,b]</m> into three subintervals using the six points 
      <m>x_0 = -\frac{\pi}{2}</m>,
      <m>x_1 = -\frac{\pi}{4}</m>,
      <m>x_2 = 0</m>, <m>x_3 = \frac{\pi}{4}</m>,
      <m>x_4 = \frac{\pi}{2}</m>,
      <m>x_5 = \frac{3 \pi}{4}</m>, and <m>x_6 = \pi</m>.
      We need three points to determine a quadratic,
      so the three subintervals of the interval <m>[a,b]</m> will be the intervals <m>[x_0, x_2]</m>,
      <m>[x_2, x_4]</m>, and <m>[x_4,x_6]</m>.
      An illustration of the process of dividing our interval <m>[a,b]</m> and approximating by 
      quadratics can be found at <url href="https://www.geogebra.org/m/spd4hhbw" visual="geogebra.org/m/spd4hhbw"/>.

    <xref ref="act_1_b_Simpson_ex_1"></xref>
    illustrates how we can model a function on an interval using a sequence of quadratic functions.
    Now we apply this polynomial curve fitting technique to derive the general formula for approximating the area between a graph of a function <m>f</m> and the <m>x</m>-axis.
    We use parabolic arcs to approximate the graph of <m>f</m> on each subinterval.
  </p>
  <p>
    We start by dividing the interval <m>[a,b]</m> over which our function is defined into some number of subintervals. We need an even number of subintervals, since we have to use three points to define each parabola. Let <m>n = 2m</m> be the number of subintervals we use. In order to make the calculations a bit easier, let the subintervals all have the same length, which we denote by <m>\Delta x</m> (the symbol <m>\Delta</m> is often used in mathematics to indicate a change in a quantity). Since we have <m>n</m> subintervals, the length of each subinterval will be <m>\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}</m>. For each <m>k</m> we let <m>x_k = a+k \Delta x</m> and <m>y_k = f(x_k)</m>. Note that <m>x_0 = a</m> and <m>x_n=b</m>. This labeling scheme is illustrated in <xref ref="F_1_b_partition"></xref>
  </p>

  <figure xml:id="F_1_b_partition">
    <caption>Subdividing the interval <m>[a,b]</m>.</caption>
    <image width="50%" source="1_b_partition"/>
  </figure>

  <p>
    We approximate <m>f</m> on each subinterval using a quadratic.
    So we need to find the quadratic
    <m>Q(x) = c_2x^2+c_1x+c_0</m> that passes through two consecutive end points as well as the midpoint of a subinterval.
    That is, we need to find the coefficients of <m>Q</m> so that <m>Q</m> passes through the points <m>(x_k,y_k)</m>,
    <m>(x_{k+2}, y_{k+2})</m>,
    and the midpoint <m>(x_{k+1},y_{k+1})</m> on the interval <m>[x_k, x_{k+2}]</m>
    (so that we have three points to which to fit a parabola)
    as shown at left in <xref ref="F_1_b_quad_fit"></xref>.
    Note that the length of the interval <m>[x_k, x_{k+2}]</m> is <m>2\Delta x</m>.
    To make the calculations easier,
    we will translate our function so that our leftmost point is <m>(-r, y_k)</m>.
    Then the middle point is <m>(0, y_{k+1})</m> and the rightmost point is
    <m>(r, y_{k+2})</m> as illustrated at right in <xref ref="F_1_b_quad_fit"></xref>,
    where <m>r = \Delta x</m>.
