  <title>True/False Questions</title>
  <introduction>
  <p>
    In many sections you will be given True/False questions.
    In each of the True/False questions,
    you will be given a statement, such as
    <q>if we add corresponding sides of two linear equations,
    then the resulting equation is a linear equation</q>
    and
    <q>one can find a system of two equations in two unknowns that has infinitely many solutions.</q>
    Your task will be to determine the truth value of the statement and to give a brief justification 
    for your choice.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that a <em>general</em> statement is considered <em>true</em>
    only when it is always true.
    For example, the first of the above statements <mdash/>
    <q>if we add corresponding sides of two linear equations,
    then the resulting equation is a linear equation</q>
    <mdash/> is a general statement.
    For this statement to be true,
    the equation we obtain by adding corresponding sides of any two linear equations has to be linear.
    If we can find two equations that do not give a linear equation when combined in this way,
    then this statement is false.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that an <em>existential</em>
    statement is considered <em>true</em>
    if there is at least one example which makes is true.
    For example, the latter of the above statements <mdash/>
    <q>one can find a system of two equations in two unknowns that has infinitely many solutions</q>
    <mdash/> is an existential statement.
    For this statement to be true,
    existence of a system of two equations in two unknowns with infinitely many solutions should suffice.
    If it is impossible to find two such equations,
    then this statement is false.
  </p>
  <p>
    To justify that something always happens or never happens,
    one would need to refer to other statements whose truth is known,
    such as theorems, definitions.
    In particular, giving an <em>example</em>
    of two linear equations that produce a linear equation when we add corresponding sides
    <em>does not justify</em> why the sum of <em>any</em>
    two linear equations is also linear.
    Using the definition of linear equations, however,
    we can justify why this new equation will always be linear:
    each side of a linear equation is linear,
    and adding linear expressions always produces a linear sum.
  </p>
  <p>
    To justify that there are examples of something happening or not happening,
    one would need to give a specific example.
    For example,
    in justifying the claim that there is a system of two equations in two unknowns with infinitely many solutions,
    it is not enough to say
    <q>An equation in two unknowns is a line in the <m>xy</m>-plane,
    so there can be two equations with the same line as their solution.</q>
    In general, you should avoid the words
    <q>can,</q>
    <q>possibly,</q>
    <q>maybe,</q>
    etc., in your justifications.
    Instead, giving an example such as
    <q>The linear system <m>x+y=1</m> and <m>2x+2y=2</m> of two equations in two unknowns has 
    infinitely many solutions since the second equation gives the same line as the first in the 
    <m>xy</m>-plane.</q>
    provides complete justification beyond a reasonable doubt.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each response to a True/False statement should be more than just True or False.
    It is important that you provide
    <em>justification</em> for your responses.
