  <title>Application: Fourier Series</title>
  <p>
    In calculus,
    a Taylor polynomial for a function <m>f</m> is a polynomial approximation that fits <m>f</m> well around the center of the approximation.
    For this reason, Taylor polynomials are good
    <em>local</em> approximations,
    but they are not in general good global approximations.
    In particular,
    if a function <m>f</m> has periodic behavior it is impossible to model <m>f</m> well globally with polynomials that have infinite limits at infinity.
    For these kinds of functions,
    trigonometric polynomials are better choices.
    Trigonometric polynomials lead us to Fourier series,
    and we will investigate how inner products allow us to use trigonometric polynomials to model musical tones later in this section.
