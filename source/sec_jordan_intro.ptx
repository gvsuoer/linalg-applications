  <p>
    We have seen several different matrix factorizations so far,
    eigenvalue decomposition
    (<xref ref="chap_diagonalization"></xref>),
    singular value decomposition
    (<xref ref="chap_SVD"></xref>),
    QR factorization
    (<xref ref="chap_gram_schmidt"></xref>),
    and LU factorization
    (<xref ref="chap_det_properties"></xref>).
    In this section, we investigate the Jordan canonical form,
    which in a way generalizes the eigenvalue decomposition.
    For matrices with an eigenvalue decomposition,
    the geometric multiplicity of each eigenvalue
    (the dimension of the corresponding eigenspace)
    must equal its algebraic multiplicity
    (the number of times the eigenvalue occurs as a root of the characteristic polynomial of the matrix).
    We know that not every matrix has an eigenvalue decomposition.
    However, every square matrix has a Jordan canonical form,
    in which we use generalized eigenvectors and block diagonal form to approximate the eigenvalue decomposition behavior.
    At the end of the section we provide a complete proof of the existence of the Jordan canonical form.
