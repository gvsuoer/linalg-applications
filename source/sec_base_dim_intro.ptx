    A basis provides a system in which we can uniquely represent every vector in the space we are considering.
    More specifically,
    every vector in the space can be expressed as a linear combination of the vectors in the basis in a unique way.
    In order to be able to cover every point in the space,
    the basis has to span the space.
    In order to be able to provide a unique coordinate for each point,
    there should not be any extra vectors in the basis,
    which is achieved by linear independence of the vectors.
    For practical reasons,
    a basis simplifies many problems because we only need to solve the problem for each of the basis vectors.
    Solutions of the other cases usually follow because every vector in the space can be expressed as a unique linear combination of the basis vectors.

    Recall that a basis for a subspace <m>W</m> of <m>\R^n</m> is a set of vectors which are linearly independent and which span <m>W</m>.

        <introduction>
          <p>
            In problem (1) we should have noticed that a space can have more than one basis,
            but that any two bases contain the same number of elements.
            This is a critically important idea that we investigate in more detail in this problem in one specific case.
            Assume that <m>W</m> is a subspace of <m>\R^n</m> that has a basis
            <m>\B = \{\vv_1, \vv_2\}</m> with two basis vectors.
            We want to see if any other basis for <m>W</m> can have a different number of elements.
            Let us now consider a set <m>U = \{\vu_1, \vu_2, \vu_3\}</m> of three vectors in <m>W</m>.
            Our goal is to determine if <m>U</m> can be a basis for <m>W</m>.
            Since <m>\B</m> is a basis for <m>W</m>,
            any vector in <m>W</m> can be written as a linear combination of the vectors in <m>\B</m>.
            So we can write
            <mdn>
              <mrow xml:id="eq_PA2_9_1">\vu_1 \amp = a_{11}\vv_1 + a_{21}\vv_2</mrow>
              <mrow xml:id="eq_PA2_9_2">\vu_2 \amp = a_{12}\vv_1 + a_{22}\vv_2</mrow>
              <mrow xml:id="eq_PA2_9_3">\vu_3 \amp = a_{13}\vv_1 + a_{23}\vv_2</mrow>
            </mdn>
            for some scalars <m>a_{ij}</m>.
            If <m>U</m> were to be a basis for <m>W</m>,
            then <m>U</m> would have to be a linearly independent set.
            To determine the independence or dependence of <m>U</m> we consider the vector equation
            <men xml:id="eq_PA2_9_4">
              x_1 \vu_1 + x_2 \vu_2 + x_3 \vu_3 = \vzero
            </men>
            for scalars <m>x_1</m>, <m>x_2</m>, and <m>x_3</m>.
          </p>
        </introduction>
            <task>
              <statement>
                <p>
                  Substitute for <m>\vu_1</m>, <m>\vu_2</m>,
                  and <m>\vu_3</m> from <xref ref="eq_PA2_9_1"/>, <xref ref="eq_PA2_9_2"/>,
                  and <xref ref="eq_PA2_9_3"/> into <xref ref="eq_PA2_9_4"/> and perform some vector algebra to show that
                  <men xml:id="eq_PA2_9_5">
                    \vzero = \left(a_{11}x_1+a_{12}x_2 + a_{13}x_3\right) \vv_1 + \left(a_{21}x_1+a_{22}x_2 + a_{23}x_3\right) \vv_2
                  </men>.

                  Recall that <m>\B = \{\vv_1, \vv_2\}</m> is a basis.
                  What does that tell us about the weights in the linear combination <xref ref="eq_PA2_9_5"/>?
                  Explain why <m>A \vx = \vzero</m>,

                  how many solutions does the system <m>A \vx = \vzero</m> have?
                  Explain.
                  
                  What does this tell us about the independence or dependence of the set <m>U</m>?
                  Why?
