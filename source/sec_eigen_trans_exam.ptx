    What follows are worked examples that use the concepts from this section.

  <example>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Let <m>T : \M_{2 \times 2} \to \M_{2 \times 2}</m> be defined by <m>T(A) = A^{\tr}</m>.
        Let <m>M_1 = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 1\amp 1\\0\amp 0 \end{array} \right]</m>,
        <m>M_2 = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 0\amp 1\\1\amp 0 \end{array} \right]</m>,
        <m>M_3 = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 1\amp 0\\1\amp 0 \end{array} \right]</m>,
        and <m>M_4 = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 0\amp 0\\1\amp 1 \end{array} \right]</m>,
        and let <m>\CB</m> be the ordered basis <m>\{M_1, M_2, M_3, M_4\}</m>.
      </p>
    </introduction>
        <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Show that <m>T</m> is a linear transformation.
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be
              <m>2 \times 2</m> matrices and let <m>c</m> be a scalar.
              The properties of the transpose show that
              <me>
                T(A+B) = (A+B)^{\tr} = A^{\tr}+B^{\tr} = T(A) + T(B)
              </me>
              and
              <me>
                T(cA) = (cA)^{\tr} = cA^{\tr} = cT(A)
              </me>.
              Thus, <m>T</m> is a linear transformation.
            </p>
          </solution>
        </task>
        <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Find <m>[T]_{\CB}</m>.
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              Notice that <m>T(M_1) = M_3</m>, <m>T(M_2) = M_2</m>,
        <m>T(M_3) = M_1</m>, and <m>T(M_4) = M_1-M_3+M_4</m>.
        So
        <me>
          [T]_{\CB} = \left[ [T(M_1)_{\CB} \  [T(M_2)_{\CB} \  [T(M_3)_{\CB} \  [T(M_4)_{\CB} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{cccr} 0\amp 0\amp 1\amp 1 \\ 0\amp 1\amp 0\amp 0 \\ 1\amp 0\amp 0\amp -1  \\ 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 1 \end{array}  \right]
        </me>.
            </p>
          </solution>
        </task>
        <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Is the matrix <m>[T]_{\CB}</m> diagonalizable?
              If so, find a matrix <m>P</m> such that
              <m>P^{-1}[T]_{\CB}P</m> is a diagonal matrix.
              Use technology as appropriate.
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              Technology shows that the characteristic polynomial of
        <m>[T]_{\CB}</m> is <m>p(\lambda) = (\lambda+1)(\lambda-1)^3</m>.
        It follows that the eigenvalues of
        <m>[T]_{\CB}</m> are <m>-1</m> and <m>1</m>
        (with multiplicity <m>3</m>).
        Technology also shows that
        <m>\{[-1 \ 0 \ 1 \ 0]^{\tr}\}</m> is a basis for the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue <m>-1</m> and the vectors <m>[1 \ 0 \ 0 \ 1]^{\tr}</m>,
        <m>[1 \ 0 \ 1 \ 0]^{\tr}</m>,
        <m>[0 \ 1 \ 0 \ 0]^{\tr}</m> form a basis for the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue <m>1</m>.
        If we let <m>P = \left[ \begin{array}{cccr} 1\amp 1\amp 0\amp -1 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 1\amp 0 \\ 0\amp 1\amp 0\amp 1 \\ 1\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0 \end{array} \right]</m>,
        then <m>P^{-1}AP = \left[ \begin{array}{cccr} 1\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0 \\ 0\amp 1\amp 0\amp 0 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 1\amp 0 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp -1 \end{array} \right]</m>.
            </p>
          </solution>
        </task>
        <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Use part (c) to find a basis <m>\CC</m> for <m>\M_{2 \times 2}</m> for which
              <m>[T]_{\CC}</m> is a diagonal matrix.
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              Suppose <m>\CC = \{Q_1, Q_2, Q_3, Q_4\}</m> is a basis for
        <m>\M_{2 \times 2}</m> satisfying <m>P^{-1}[T]_{\CB}P = [T]_{\CC}</m>.
        This makes <m>[T]_{\CC}</m> a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues of <m>[T]_{\CB}</m> along the diagonal.
        In this case we have
        <me>
          [T]_{\CC}[A]_{\CC} = P^{-1}[T]_{\CB}P[A]_{\CC}
        </me>
        for any matrix <m>A \in \M_{2 \times 2}</m>.
        So <m>P</m> is the change of basis matrix from <m>\CC</m> to <m>\CB</m>.
        That is, <m>P[A]_{\CC} = [A]_{\CB}</m>.
        It follows that <m>P[Q_i]_{\CC} = [Q_i]_{\CB}</m> for <m>i</m> from <m>1</m> to <m>4</m>.
        Since <m>[Q_i]_{\CC} = \ve_i</m>,
        we can see that <m>[Q_i]_{\CB}</m> is the <m>i</m>th column of <m>P</m>.
        So the  columns of <m>P</m> provide the weights for basis vectors in <m>\CC</m> in terms of the basis <m>\CB</m>.
        Letting <m>Q_1 = M_1+M_4</m>,
        <m>Q_2 = M_1+M_3</m>, <m>Q_3=M_2</m>, and <m>Q_4 = M_3-M_1</m>,
        we conclude that <m>[T]_{\CC}</m> is a diagonal matrix.

  <example>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        We have shown that every linear transformation from a finite dimensional vector space <m>V</m> to <m>V</m> can be represented as a matrix transformation.
        As a consequence, all such linear transformations have eigenvalues.
        In this example we consider the problem of determining eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the linear transformation
        <m>T : V \to V</m> defined by <m>T(f)(x) = \int_0^x f(t) \, dt</m>,
        where <m>V</m> is the vector space of all infinitely differentiable functions from <m>\R</m> to <m>\R</m>.
        Suppose that <m>f</m> is an eigenvector of <m>T</m> with a nonzero eigenvalue.
      </p>
    </introduction>
        <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to show that <m>f</m> must satisfy the equation
              <m>f'(x) = \frac{1}{\lambda} f(x)</m> for some scalar nonzero scalar <m>\lambda</m>.
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              Assuming that <m>f</m> is an eigenvector of <m>T</m> with nonzero eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m>, then
        <men xml:id="eq_8_c_integral">
          \lambda f(x) = T(f)(x) = \int_0^x f(t) \, dt
        </men>.
        Recall that <m>\frac{d}{dx}  \int_0^x f(t) \, dt = f(x)</m> by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
        Differentiating both sides of <xref ref="eq_8_c_integral"/> with respect to <m>x</m> leaves us with <m>\lambda f'(x) = f(x)</m>,
        or <m>f'(x) = \frac{1}{\lambda} f(x)</m>.
            </p>
          </solution>
        </task>
        <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              From calculus,
              we know that the functions <m>f</m> that satisfy the equation <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{\lambda} f'(x)</m> all have the form
              <m>f(x) = Ae^{x/\lambda}</m> for some scalar <m>A</m>.
              So if <m>f</m> is an eigenvector of <m>T</m>,
              then <m>f(x) = Ae^{x/\lambda}</m> for some scalar <m>A</m>.
              Show, however,
              that <m>Ae^{x/\lambda}</m> cannot be an eigenvector of <m>T</m>.
              Thus, <m>T</m> has no eigenvectors with nonzero eigenvalues.
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              We can directly check from the definition that <m>T(f)</m> is not a multiple of
        <m>f(x)=Ae^{x/\lambda}</m> unless <m>A=0</m>, which is not allowed.
        Another method is to note that <m>T(f)(0) = \int_0^0 f(t) \, dt = 0</m> by definition.
        But if <m>f(x) = Ae^{x/\lambda}</m>, then
        <me>
          0 = T(f)(0) = \lambda f(0) = Ae^{0/\lambda} = A
        </me>.
        This means that  <m>f(x) = 0e^{x/\lambda} = 0</m>.
        But <m>0</m> can never be an eigenvector by definition.
        So <m>T</m> has no eigenvectors with nonzero eigenvalues.
            </p>
          </solution>
        </task>
        <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Now show that <m>0</m> is not an eigenvalue of <m>T</m>.
              Conclude that <m>T</m> has no eigenvalues or eigenvectors.
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              Suppose that <m>0</m> is an eigenvalue of <m>T</m>.
        Then there is a nonzero function <m>g</m> such that <m>T(g) = 0</m>.
        In other words, <m>0 = \int_0^x g(t) \, dt</m>.
        Again, differentiating with respect to <m>x</m> yields the equation <m>g(x) = 0</m>.
        So <m>T</m> has no eigenvectors with eigenvalue <m>0</m>.
        Since <m>T</m> does not have a nonzero eigenvalue or zero as an eigenvalue,
        <m>T</m> has no eigenvalues
        (and eigenvectors).
            </p>
          </solution>
        </task>
        <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Explain why this example does not contradict the statement that every linear transformation from a finite dimensional vector space <m>V</m> to <m>V</m> has eigenvalues.
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              The reason this example does not contradict the statement is that <m>V</m> is an infinite dimensional vector space.
        In fact, the linearly independent monomials <m>t^m</m> are all in <m>V</m> for any positive integer <m>m</m>.
