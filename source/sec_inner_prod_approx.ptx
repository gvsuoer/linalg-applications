  <title>Best Approximations in Inner Product Spaces</title>
  <p>
    We have seen,
    e.g., linear regression to fit a line to a set of data,
    that we often want to find a vector in a subspace that
    <q>best</q>
    approximates a given vector in a vector space.
    As in <m>\R^n</m>,
    the projection of a vector onto a subspace has this important property.
    That is, <m>\proj_W \vv</m> is the vector in <m>W</m> closest to <m>\vv</m> and therefore the best approximation of <m>\vv</m> by a vector in <m>W</m>.
    To see that this is true in any inner product space,
    we first need a generalization of the Pythagorean Theorem that holds in inner product spaces.

  <theorem xml:id="thm_6_c_PT">
    <title>Generalized Pythagorean Theorem</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> be orthogonal vectors in an inner product space <m>V</m>.
        Then
        <me>
          ||\vu - \vv||^2 = ||\vu||^2 + ||\vv||^2
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  

  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> be orthogonal vectors in an inner product space <m>V</m>.
      Then
      <md>
        <mrow>|| \vu - \vv ||^2 \amp = \langle \vu-\vv, \vu-\vv \rangle</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \langle \vu,\vu \rangle - 2 \langle \vu,\vv \rangle + \langle \vv, \vv \rangle</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \langle \vu,\vu \rangle - 2 (0) + \langle \vv, \vv \rangle</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = ||\vu||^2 + ||\vv||^2</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>
  </proof>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    Note that replacing <m>\vv</m> with <m>-\vv</m> in the theorem also shows that
    <m>||\vu + \vv||^2 = ||\vu||^2 + ||\vv||^2</m> if <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> are orthogonal.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now we will prove that the projection of a vector <m>\vu</m> onto a subspace <m>W</m> of an inner product space <m>V</m> is the best approximation in <m>W</m> to the vector <m>\vu</m>.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm_6_c_best_approx">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>W</m> be a subspace of an inner product space <m>V</m> and let <m>\vu</m> be a vector in <m>V</m>.
        Then
        <me>
          ||\vu - \proj_W \vu || \lt  || \vu - \vx ||
        </me>
        for every vector <m>\vx</m> in <m>W</m> different from <m>\proj_W \vu</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>W</m> be a subspace of an inner product space <m>V</m> and let <m>\vu</m> be a vector in <m>V</m>.
      Let <m>\vx</m> be a vector in <m>W</m>.
      Now
      <me>
        \vu - \vx = (\vu-\proj_W \vu) + (\proj_W \vu - \vx)
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since both <m>\proj_W \vu</m> and <m>\vx</m> are in <m>W</m>,
      we know that <m>\proj_W \vu - \vx</m> is in <m>W</m>.
      Since <m>\proj_{W^{\perp}} \vu = \vu-\proj_W \vu</m> is orthogonal to every vector in <m>W</m>,
      we have that <m>\vu-\proj_W \vu</m> is orthogonal to <m>\proj_W \vu - \vx</m>.
      We can now use the Generalized Pythagorean Theorem to conclude that
      <me>
        ||\vu - \vx||^2 = ||\vu-\proj_W \vu||^2 + ||\proj_W \vu - \vx||^2
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since <m>\vx \neq \proj_W \vu</m>,
      it follows that <m>||\proj_W \vu - \vx||^2 > 0</m> and
      <me>
        || \vu - \vx ||^2 > ||\vu - \proj_W \vu ||^2
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since norms are nonnegative,
      we can conclude that <m>||\vu - \proj_W \vu || \lt || \vu - \vx ||</m> as desired.
    </p>
  </proof>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    <xref ref="thm_6_c_best_approx"></xref>
    shows that the distance from
    <m>\proj_W \vv</m> to <m>\vv</m> is less than the distance from any other vector in <m>W</m> to <m>\vv</m>.
    So <m>\proj_W \vv</m> is the best approximation to <m>\vv</m> of all the vectors in <m>W</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In <m>\R^n</m> using the dot product as inner product,
    if <m>\vv = [v_1 \ v_2 \ v_3 \ \ldots \ v_n]^{\tr}</m> and <m>\proj_W \vv =  [w_1 \ w_2 \ w_3 \ \ldots \ w_n]^{\tr}</m>,
    then the square of the error in approximating <m>\vv</m> by <m>\proj_W \vv</m> is given by
    <me>
      || \vv - \proj_W \vv ||^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n (v_i - w_i)^2
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    So <m>\proj_W \vv</m> minimizes this sum of squares over all vectors in <m>W</m>.
    As a result, we call <m>\proj_W \vv</m> the
    <term>least squares approximation</term> to <m>\vv</m>.

      The set <m>\CB = \{1, t-\frac{1}{2}, t^3-\frac{9}{10}t+\frac{1}{5}\}</m> is an orthogonal basis for a subspace <m>W</m> of the inner product space <m>\pol_3</m> using the inner product <m>\langle p(t),
