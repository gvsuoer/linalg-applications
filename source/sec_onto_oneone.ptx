  <title>Onto and One-to-One Transformations</title>
  <p>
    Recall that in <xref ref="chap_matrix_transformations"></xref>
    we expressed existence and uniqueness questions for matrix equations in terms of one-to-one and onto properties of matrix transformations.
    The question about the existence of a solution to the matrix equation
    <m>A \vx = \vb</m> for any vector <m>\vb</m>,
    where <m>A</m> is an <m>m \times n</m> matrix,
    is also a question about the existence of a vector <m>\vx</m> so that <m>T(\vx) = \vb</m>,
    where <m>T(\vx) = A \vx</m>.
    If, for each <m>\vb</m> in <m>\R^m</m> there is at least one <m>\vx</m> with <m>T(\vx) = \vb</m>,
    then <m>T</m> is an onto transformation.
    We can make a similar definition for any linear transformation.
  </p>

  <definition>
  <idx><h>linear transformation</h><h>onto</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A linear transformation <m>T</m> from a vector space <m>V</m> to a vector space <m>W</m> is
        <term>onto</term> if each <m>\vb</m> in <m>W</m> is the image of at least one <m>\vx</m> in <m>V</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    Similarly, the uniqueness of a solution to
    <m>A \vx = \vb</m> for any <m>\vb</m> in <m>\Col A</m> is the same as saying that for any <m>\vb</m> in <m>\R^m</m>,
    there is at most one <m>\vx</m> in <m>\R^n</m> such that <m>T(\vx) = \vb</m>.
    A matrix transformation with this property is one-to-one,
    and we can make a similar definition for any linear transformation.
  </p>

  <definition>
  <idx><h>linear transformation</h><h>onto</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A linear transformation <m>T</m> from a vector space <m>V</m> to a vector space <m>W</m> is
        <term>one-to-one</term> if each <m>\vb</m> in <m>W</m> is the image of at most one <m>\vx</m> in <m>V</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    With matrix transformations we saw that there are easy pivot criteria for determining whether a matrix transformation is one-to-one (a pivot in each column) or onto (a pivot in each row).
    If a linear transformation can be represented as a matrix transformation,
    then we can use these ideas.
    However, not every general linear transformation can be easily viewed as a matrix transformation,
    and in those cases we might have to resort to applying the definitions directly.

      For each of the following transformations,
      determine if <m>T</m> is one-to-one and/or onto.
