  <title>Finding a Basis for a Subspace</title>
  <p>
    Since every vector in a subspace of <m>\R^n</m> can be written uniquely as a linear combination of vectors in a basis for the subspace,
    a basis provides us with the most efficient and convenient way to represent vectors in the subspace.
    Until now we have been given a set of vectors and have been asked to find a basis from that set,
    so an important question to address is how we can find a basis for a subspace <m>W</m> of <m>\R^n</m> starting from scratch.
    Here is one way.
    If <m>W = \{\vzero\}</m>,
    then the dimension of <m>W</m> is 0 and <m>W</m> has no basis.
    So suppose <m>\dim(W) > 0</m>.
    Start by choosing any nonzero vector <m>\vw_1</m> in <m>W</m>.
    Let <m>\B_1 = \{\vw_1\}</m>.
    If <m>\B_1</m> spans <m>W</m>,
    then <m>\B_1</m> is a basis for <m>W</m>.
    If not, there is a vector <m>\vw_2</m> in <m>W</m> that is not in <m>\Span(\B_1)</m>.
    Then <m>\B_2 = \{\vw_1, \vw_2\}</m> is a linearly independent set.
    If <m>\Span(\B_2) = W</m>,
    then <m>\B_2</m> is a basis for <m>W</m> and we are done.
    If not, repeat the process.
    Since any basis for <m>W</m> can contain at most <m>n=\dim(\R^n)</m> vectors,
    we know the process must stop at some point.
    This process also allows us to construct a basis for a vector space that contains a given nonzero vector.

      Find a basis for <m>\R^3</m> that contains the vector <m>\left[ \begin{array}{r} 1 \\ 2 \\ -1 \end{array} \right]</m>.
      When constructing your basis,
      how do you know when to stop?
