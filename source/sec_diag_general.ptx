  <title>Diagonalization in General</title>
  <p>
    In <xref ref="pa_4_c"></xref>
    and in the matrix transformation example we found that a matrix <m>A</m> was similar to a diagonal matrix whose columns were eigenvectors of <m>A</m>.
    This will work for a general
    <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> as long as we can find an invertible matrix <m>P</m> whose columns are eigenvectors of <m>A</m>.
    More specifically, suppose <m>A</m> is an
    <m>n \times n</m> matrix with <m>n</m> linearly independent eigenvectors <m>\vv_1</m>,
    <m>\vv_1</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
    <m>\vv_n</m> with corresponding eigenvalues <m>\lambda_1</m>,
    <m>\lambda_1</m>,
    <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\lambda_n</m>
    (not necessarily distinct).
    Let
    <me>
      P = [ \vv_1 \  \vv_2  \ \vv_3  \ \cdots  \ \vv_n]
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then
    <md>
      <mrow>AP \amp = [ A\vv_1  \ A\vv_2  \ A\vv_3  \ \cdots  \ A\vv_n]</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp = [ \lambda_1\vv_1  \ \lambda_2\vv_2  \ \lambda_3\vv_3  \ \cdots  \ \lambda_n\vv_n]</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp = [ \vv_1 \  \vv_2  \ \vv_3  \ \cdots  \ \vv_n]\left[ \begin{array}{cccccc} \lambda_1\amp 0\amp 0\amp \cdots\amp 0\amp 0</mrow>
      <mrow>0\amp \lambda_2\amp 0\amp \cdots\amp 0\amp 0</mrow>
      <mrow>\vdots\amp \vdots\amp \amp  \cdots\amp \vdots\amp \vdots</mrow>
      <mrow>0\amp 0\amp 0\amp \cdots\amp \lambda_{n-1}\amp 0</mrow>
      <mrow>0\amp 0\amp 0\amp \cdots\amp 0\amp \lambda_{n} \end{array} \right]</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp = P D</mrow>
    </md>.
    where
    <me>
      D = \left[ \begin{array}{cccccc} \lambda_1\amp 0\amp 0\amp \cdots\amp 0\amp 0 \\ 0\amp \lambda_2\amp 0\amp \cdots\amp 0\amp 0 \\ \vdots\amp \vdots\amp \amp  \cdots\amp \vdots\amp \vdots \\ 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp \cdots\amp \lambda_{n-1}\amp 0 \\  0\amp 0\amp 0\amp \cdots\amp 0\amp \lambda_{n} \end{array}  \right]
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since the columns of <m>P</m> are linearly independent,
    we know <m>P</m> is invertible, and so
    <me>
      P^{-1}AP = D
    </me>.

  <title>IMPORTANT NOTE</title>
  <p>
    The key notion to the process described above is that in order to diagonalize an <m>n\times n</m> matrix <m>A</m>,
    we have to find <m>n</m> linearly independent eigenvectors for <m>A</m>.
    When <m>A</m> is diagonalizable,
    a matrix <m>P</m> so that <m>P^{-1}AP</m> is diagonal is said to
    <term>diagonalize</term> <m>A</m>.

  <p>
    It should be noted that there are square matrices that are not diagonalizable.
    For example,
    the matrix <m>A = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 1\amp 1 \\ 0\amp 1 \end{array} \right]</m> has 1 as its only eigenvalue and the dimension of the eigenspace of <m>A</m> corresponding to the eigenvalue is one.
    Therefore, it will be impossible to find two linearly independent eigenvectors for <m>A</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We showed previously that eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalue are always linearly independent,
    so if an <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> has <m>n</m> distinct eigenvalues then <m>A</m> is diagonalizable.
    <xref ref="act_4_c_3"></xref>
    (b) shows that it is possible to diagonalize an
    <m>n \times n</m> matrix even if the matrix does not have <m>n</m> distinct eigenvalues.
    In general, we can diagonalize a matrix as long as the dimension of each eigenspace is equal to the multiplicity of the corresponding eigenvalue.
    In other words,
    a matrix is diagonalizable if the geometric multiplicity is the same is the algebraic multiplicity for each eigenvalue.
  </p>
  <p>
    At this point we might ask one final question.
    We argued that if an <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> has <m>n</m> linearly independent eigenvectors,
    then <m>A</m> is diagonalizable.
    It is reasonable to wonder if the converse is true <mdash/> that is,
    if <m>A</m> is diagonalizable,
    must <m>A</m> have <m>n</m> linearly independent eigenvectors?
    The answer is yes,
    and you are asked to show this in <xref ref="ex_4_c_diagonal_converse"></xref>.
    We summarize the result in the following theorem.
  </p>

  <theorem>
    <title>The Diagonalization Theorem</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        An <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> is diagonalizable if and only if <m>A</m> has <m>n</m> linearly independent eigenvectors.
        If <m>A</m> is diagonalizable and has linearly independent eigenvectors <m>\vv_1</m>,
        <m>\vv_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
        <m>\vv_n</m> with <m>A\vv_i = \lambda_i \vv_i</m> for each <m>i</m>,
        then <m>n \times n</m> matrix
        <m>P [ \vv_1 \ \vv_2 \ \cdots \ \vv_n]</m> whose columns are linearly independent eigenvectors of <m>A</m> satisfies <m>P^{-1}AP = D</m>,
        where <m>D = [d_{ij}]</m> is the diagonal matrix with diagonal entries <m>d_{ii} = \lambda_i</m> for each <m>i</m>.
