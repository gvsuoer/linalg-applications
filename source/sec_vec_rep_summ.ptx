        A vector is a list of numbers in a specified order.

        We add two vectors of the same size by adding corresponding components.
        In other words,
        if <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> are vectors of the same size and <m>u_i</m> and <m>v_i</m> are the <m>i</m> components of <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m>,
        respectively,
        then <m>\vu +\vv</m> is the vector whose <m>i</m>th component is <m>u_i+v_i</m> for each <m>i</m>.
        Geometrically,
        we represent the sum of two vectors using the Parallelogram Rule: The vector <m>\vu+\vv</m> is the directed line segment from the origin to the 4th point of the parallelogram formed by the origin and the vectors <m>\vu, \vv</m>.

        A scalar multiple of a vector is found by multiplying each component of the vector by that scalar.
        In other words,
        if <m>v_i</m> is the <m>i</m> component of the vector <m>\vv</m> and <m>c</m> is any scalar,
        then <m>c\vv</m> is the vector whose <m>i</m> component is <m>cv_i</m> for each <m>i</m>.
        Geometrically,
        a scalar multiple of a nonzero vector <m>\vv</m> is a vector in the same direction as <m>\vv</m> if <m>c>0</m> and in the opposite direction if <m>c\lt 0</m>.
        If <m>|c|>1</m>, the vector is stretched,
        and if <m>|c|\lt 1</m>, the vector is shrunk.

        An important concept is that of a linear combination of vectors.
        In words, a linear combination of a collection of vectors is a sum of scalar multiples of the vectors.
        More formally,
        we defined a linear combination of vectors <m>\vv_1</m>,
        <m>\vv_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
        <m>\vv_m</m> in <m>\R^n</m> is any vector of the form <m>c_1 \vv_1 + c_2 \vv_2 + \cdots + c_m \vv_m</m>,
        where <m>c_1</m>, <m>c_2</m>,
        <m>\ldots</m>, <m>c_m</m> are scalars.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        To find weights <m>c_1</m>, <m>c_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
        <m>c_m</m> so that a vector <m>\vw</m> in <m>\R^n</m> is a linear combination of the vectors <m>\vv_1</m>,
        <m>\vv_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\vv_m</m> in <m>\R^n</m>,
        we simply solve the system corresponding to the augmented matrix
        <me>
          [\vv_1 \  \vv_2 \  \vv_3 \ \cdots \ \vv_m | \ \vw]
        </me>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The collection of all linear combinations of a set of vectors is called the span of the set of vectors.
        More formally,
        the span of the vectors <m>\vv_1</m>, <m>\vv_2</m>,
        <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\vv_m</m> in <m>\R^n</m> is the set
        <me>
          \{c_1\vv_1 + c_2\vv_2 + \cdots + c_m\vv_m : c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_m \text{ are scalars } \}
        </me>,
        which we denote as <m>\Span \{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_m\}</m>.
        Geometrically,
        the span of a single nonzero vector <m>\vv</m> in any dimension is the line through the origin and the vector <m>\vv</m>.
        The span of two vectors <m>\vv_1, \vv_2</m> in any dimension neither of which is a multiple of the other is a plane through the origin containing both vectors.
