  <title>Application: Global Positioning System</title>
  <p>
    You are probably familiar with the Global Positioning System (GPS).
    The system allows anyone with the appropriate software to accurately determine their location at any time.
    The applications are almost endless,
    including getting real-time driving directions while in your car,
    guiding missiles, and providing distances on golf courses.

    The GPS is a worldwide radio-navigation system owned by the US government and operated by the US Air Force.
    GPS is one of four global navigation satellite systems.
    At least twenty four GPS satellites orbit the Earth at an altitude of approximately 11,000 nautical miles.
    The satellites are placed so that at any time at least four of them can be accessed by a GPS receiver.
    Each satellite carries an atomic clock to relay a time stamp along with its position in space.
    There are five ground stations to coordinate and ensure that the system is working properly.

    The system works by triangulation,
    but there is also error involved in the measurements that go into determining position.
    Later in this section we will see how the method of least squares can be used to determine the receiver's position.
