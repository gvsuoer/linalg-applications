  <title>The Coordinate Transformation</title>
  <idx><h>coordinate transformation</h></idx>
  <p>
    We have seen that both <m>\R^2</m> and <m>\pol_1</m> are vector spaces of dimension 2.
    Moreover, we can pair the polynomial
    <m>a_0+a_1t</m> in <m>\pol_1</m> with the vector
    <m>[a_0 \ a_1]</m> in <m>\R^2</m> as the coordinate vector of
    <m>a_0+a_1t</m> with respect to the standard basis for <m>\pol_1</m>.
    In this way we can see that the vector space <m>\pol_1</m>
    <q>looks</q>
    like the vector space <m>\R^2</m>.
    In fact, using this same idea,
    we can show that any vector space of dimension <m>n</m>
    <q>looks</q>
    like <m>\R^n</m>.
    The key idea to make this work is the coordinate transformation.
  </p>
  <p>
    As we saw in <xref ref="pa_5_d"></xref>,
    the coordinate vector of a vector with respect to a basis depends on the basis we choose.
    In this activity we found that
    <m>[2+4t]_{\CB} = \left[ 1 \ \frac{1}{3} \right]^{\tr}</m> and <m>[2+4t]_{\CC} = [ 3 \ -1]^{\tr}</m>,
    where <m>\CB = \{4+2t, -6+6t\}</m> and <m>\CC = \{1+t, 1-t\}</m>.
    These coordinate vectors allow us to identify polynomials in <m>\pol_1</m> with vectors in <m>\R^2</m>.
    In this way,
    the coordinate vectors provide an identification between the vector space <m>\pol_1</m> and the vector space <m>\R^2</m> via a
    <term>coordinate transformation</term>.

      <p>
        Let <m>V</m> be a vector space of dimension <m>n</m> with basis <m>\CB</m>.
        The <term>coordinate transformation</term> <m>T</m> from <m>V</m> to <m>\R^n</m> with respect to the ordered basis <m>\CB</m> is the mapping defined by
        <me>

        for any vector <m>\vx</m> in <m>V</m>.

    Coordinate transformations have several useful properties that allow us to use them to compare the structure of vector spaces.

    shows that coordinate transformations behave in ways similar to matrix transformations.
    Recall that if <m>A</m> is an <m>m \times n</m> matrix, then
    <me>
      A(\vu+\vw) = A\vu + A\vw \ \text{ and }  \ A(c\vu) = cA\vu
    </me>
    for any vectors <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vw</m> in <m>\R^n</m> and any scalar <m>c</m>.
    Because of these properties,
    the transformation <m>A</m> preserves linear combinations.
    That is, if <m>\vv_1</m>, <m>\vv_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
    and <m>\vv_n</m> are any vectors in <m>\R^n</m> and <m>c_1</m>,
    <m>c_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>c_n</m> are any scalars, then
    <me>
      A(c_1 \vv_1 + c_2 \vv_2 + \cdots + c_n \vv_n) = c_1 A\vv_1 + c_2 A\vv_2 + \cdots + c_n A\vv_n

    for any vectors <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vw</m> in <m>V</m> and any scalar <m>c</m>.
    The fact that any coordinate transformation satisfies these properties is contained in the following theorem.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm_5_d_5">
    <statement>
      <p>
        If a vector space <m>V</m> has a basis <m>\CB</m> of <m>n</m> vectors,
        then the coordinate mapping
        <m>T : V \to \R^n</m> defined by <m>T(\vx) = [\vx]_{\CB}</m> satisfies
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>T(\vu + \vw) = T(\vu) + T(\vw)</m> and
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>T(c\vu) = cT(\vu)</m>

        for any vectors <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vw</m> in <m>V</m> and any scalar <m>c</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>\vv_1</m>, <m>\vv_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
      and <m>\vv_n</m> be vectors that form a basis <m>\CB</m> for a vector space <m>V</m>.
      To verify the first property,
      let <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vw</m> be two arbitrary vectors from <m>V</m>.
      We will show that <m>T(\vu)+T(\vw) = T(\vu + \vw)</m> for these two vectors.
      Consider <m>T(\vu)</m>.
      If <m>T(\vu)=[u_1 \ u_2 \ \ldots \ u_n]^{\tr}</m>,
      then the fact that <m>T(\vu)= [\vu]_\CB</m> implies that
      <me>
        \vu = u_1\vv_1 + u_2\vv_2 + \cdots + u_n \vv_n \,
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, if <m>T(\vw)=[w_1 \ w_2 \ \ldots \ w_n]^{\tr}</m>,
      then <m>T(\vw)=[\vw]_\CB</m> implies that
      <me>
        \vw = w_1\vv_1 + w_2\vv_2 + \cdots + w_n \vv_n \,
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We then obtain
      <md>
        <mrow>\vu+\vw \amp = (u_1\vv_1 + u_2\vv_2 + \cdots + u_n \vv_n) + (w_1\vv_1 + w_2\vv_2 + \cdots + w_n \vv_n)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = (u_1+w_1)\vv_1 + (u_2+w_2)\vv_2 + \cdots + (u_n+w_n) \vv_n</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, by definition of <m>T</m> again,
      <me>
        T(\vu+\vw)= [\vu+\vw]_{\CB} = [(u_1+w_1) \ (u_2+w_2) \ \ldots \ (u_n+w_n)]^{\tr}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To show that <m>T(\vu + \vw) = T(\vu) + T(\vw)</m>, note that
      <md>
        <mrow>T(\vu) + T(\vw) \amp = [u_1 \ u_2 \ \ldots \ u_n]^{\tr} + [w_1 \ w_2 \ \ldots \ w_n]^{\tr}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = [(u_1+w_1) \ (u_2+w_2) \  \ldots \ (u_n+w_n)]^{\tr}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = [\vu+\vw]_{\CB}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = T(\vu+\vw)</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proof of the second property is left for the exercises.
    </p>
  </proof>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    <xref ref="thm_5_d_5"></xref>
    can be extended to any linear combination of vectors by mathematical induction.
    That is, if <m>T : V \to \R^n</m> is the coordinate mapping defined by
    <m>T(\vx) = [\vx]_{\CB}</m> for some basis <m>\CB</m>,
    and if <m>\vu_1</m>, <m>\vu_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
    <m>\vu_m</m> are vectors in an <m>n</m>-dimensional vector space <m>V</m> with basis <m>\CB</m>,
    and <m>x_1</m>, <m>x_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>x_m</m> are scalars,
    then <m>T(x_1\vu_1+x_2\vu_2+\cdots +x_m\vu_m) = x_1T(\vu_1) + x_2T(\vu_2) + \cdots + x_mT(\vu_m)</m>.
    In other words,
    <me>
      [x_1\vu_1+x_2\vu_2+\cdots + x_m\vu_m]_{\CB}  =  x_1[\vu_1]_{\CB} +  x_2[\vu_2]_{\CB} + \cdots +  x_m[\vu_m]_{\CB}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In other words,
    coordinate transformations take linear combinations of vectors in <m>V</m> to linear combinations of vectors in <m>\R^n</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In essence, a coordinate transformation makes an identification of any vector space of dimension <m>n</m> with <m>\R^n</m>.
    One of the driving forces behind this identification is the fact that,
    just as in <m>\R^n</m>,
    if a vector space <m>V</m> has a basis of <m>n</m> elements,
    then any basis for <m>V</m> will have exactly <m>n</m> elements.
    The fact that any coordinate transformation from a vector space <m>V</m> to <m>\R^n</m> is linear means that elements in <m>V</m> behave the same way with respect to addition and multiplication by scalars in <m>V</m> as do their images in <m>\R^n</m> under the coordinate transformation.
    To make this identification complete,
    there are still two questions to address.
    First, given a coordinate transformation <m>T</m> from a vector space <m>V</m> to <m>\R^n</m>,
    is is possible for two vectors in <m>V</m> to have the same image in <m>\R^n</m>
    (in other words, is <m>T</m> one-to-one),
    and is every vector in <m>\R^n</m> the image of some vector in <m>V</m> under <m>T</m> (in other words,
    does <m>T</m> map <m>V</m> onto <m>\R^n</m>)?
    If the coordinate transformations are one-to-one and onto, then,
    in essence,
    any vector space of dimension <m>n</m> is just a copy of <m>\R^n</m>.
    As a result,
    to understand any vector space with a basis of <m>n</m> vectors,
    it is enough to understand <m>\R^n</m>.

      Let <m>V</m> be a vector space with an ordered basis <m>\CB = \{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_n\}</m>.
      Then <m>T</m> maps <m>V</m> into <m>\R^n</m>.
      We want to show that <m>T</m> maps <m>V</m> onto <m>\R^n</m>.
      Recall that a function <m>f</m> from a set <m>X</m> to a set <m>Y</m> is onto if for any element <m>y</m> in <m>Y</m>,

    shows that a coordinate transformation maps an <m>n</m>-dimensional vector space <m>V</m> onto <m>\R^n</m>.
    What's more, any coordinate transformation is also one-to-one
    (the proof that <m>T</m> is one-to-one is left for the exercises).
    We summarize these results in the following theorem.

  <theorem xml:id="thm_5_d_6">

        If a vector space <m>V</m> has a basis <m>\CB</m> of <m>n</m> vectors,

    show that a coordinate transformation from an <m>n</m>-dimensional vector space <m>V</m> with basis <m>\CB</m> to <m>\R^n</m> provides an identification of <m>V</m> with <m>\R^n</m>,
    where a vector <m>\vv</m> in <m>V</m> is identified with the vector <m>[\vv]_{\CB}</m>.
    This identification allows us to transfer questions
    (linear dependence, independence, span)
    in <m>V</m> to <m>\R^n</m> where we can apply our knowledge of matrices to answer the questions.
