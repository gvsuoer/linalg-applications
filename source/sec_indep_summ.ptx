        A set <m>\{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_k\}</m> of vectors in <m>\R^n</m> is linearly 
        independent if the vector equation
        <me>
          x_1 \vv_1 + x_2 \vv_2 + \cdots + x_k \vv_k = \vzero
        </me>
        for scalars <m>x_1, x_2, \ldots,
        x_k</m> has only the trivial solution
        <me>
          x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = \cdots = x_k = 0
        </me>.
        Another way to think about this is that a set of vectors is linearly independent if 
        no vector in the set can be written as a linear combination of the other vectors in the set.

        A set <m>\{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_k\}</m> of vectors in <m>\R^n</m> is linearly 
        dependent if the vector equation
        <me>
          x_1 \vv_1 + x_2 \vv_2 + \cdots + x_k \vv_k = \vzero
        </me>
        has a nontrivial solution.
        That is, we can find scalars
        <m>x_1, x_2, \ldots,
        x_k</m> that are not all 0 so that
        <me>
          x_1 \vv_1 + x_2 \vv_2 + \cdots + x_k \vv_k = \vzero
        </me>.
        Another way to think about this is that a set of vectors is linearly dependent if 
        at least one vector in the set can be written as a linear combination of the other vectors in the set.

        If <m>S</m> is a set of vectors,
        a subset <m>B</m> of <m>S</m> is a basis for
        <m>\Span \ S</m> if <m>B</m> is a linearly independent set and <m>\Span \ B = \Span \ S</m>.

        Given a nonzero set <m>S</m> of vectors,
        we can remove vectors from <m>S</m> that are linear combinations of remaining
        vectors in <m>S</m> to obtain a linearly independent subset of <m>S</m> that has the 
        same span as <m>S</m>.

        The columns of a matrix <m>A</m> are linearly independent if the equation
        <m>A \vx = \vzero</m> has only the trivial solution <m>\vx = \vzero</m>.

    <li>
      <p>
        The set <m>\{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_k\}</m> is linearly independent if and only 
        if every column of the matrix <m>A = [\vv_1 \ \vv_2 \ \vv_3 \ \cdots \ \vv_k]</m>,
        is a pivot column.
      </p>

    <li>
      <p>
        If <m>A = [\vv_1 \ \vv_2 \ \vv_3 \ \cdots \ \vv_k]</m>,
        then the vectors in the pivot columns of <m>A</m> form a minimal spanning set for 
        <m>\Span \{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_k\}</m>.
