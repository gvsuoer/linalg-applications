  <title>The Null Space of a Matrix and the Kernel of a Matrix Transformation</title>
  <p>
    In this section we explore the <em>null space</em>
    and see how the null space of a matrix is related to the matrix transformation defined by the matrix.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let <m>A</m> be an <m>m \times n</m> matrix.
    In Preview <xref ref="pa_3_b">Activity</xref>
    we defined the null space of a matrix <m>A</m>
    (see <xref ref="def_null_space">Definition</xref>)
    as the set of solutions to the matrix equation <m>A \vx = \vzero</m>.
    Note that the null space of an
    <m>m \times n</m> matrix is a subset of <m>\R^n</m>.
    We saw that the null space of <m>A</m> is closed under addition and scalar multiplication <mdash/> that is,
    if <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> are in <m>\Nul A</m> and <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are any scalars,
    then <m>\vu + \vv</m> and <m>a \vu</m> are also in <m>\Nul A</m>.
    Since the zero vector is always in <m>\Nul A</m>,
    we can conclude that the null space of <m>A</m> is a subspace of <m>\R^n</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is a connection between the null space of a matrix and the matrix transformation it defines.
    Recall that any <m>m \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> defines a matrix transformation <m>T</m> from <m>\R^n</m> to <m>\R^m</m> by <m>T(\vx) = A \vx</m>.
    The null space of <m>A</m> is then the collection of vectors <m>\vx</m> in <m>\R^n</m> so that <m>T(\vx) = \vzero</m>.
    So if <m>T</m> is a matrix transformation from <m>\R^n</m> to <m>\R^m</m>,
    then the set
    <me>
      \{\vx \text{ in }  \R^n : T(\vx) = \vzero\}
    </me>
    is a subspace of <m>\R^n</m> equal to the null space of <m>A</m>.
    This set is is given a special name.
  </p>

    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>T : \R^n \to \R^n</m> be a matrix transformation.
        The <term>kernel</term>
            <idx><h>kernel</h></idx>
        of <m>T</m> is the set
        <me>
          \Ker(T) = \{\vx \in \R^n : T(\vx) = \vzero\}

      If <m>T</m> is a matrix transformation defined by a matrix <m>A</m>,

            To find the vectors in the null space of a matrix <m>A</m> we solve the system <m>A \vx = \vzero</m>.
            Since a homogeneous system is always consistent,
            there are two possibilities for <m>\Nul A</m>:
            either <m>\Nul A = \{\vzero\}</m> or <m>\Nul A</m> contains infinitely many vectors.

    Recall that for a function to be one-to-one,
    each output must come from exactly one input.
    Since a matrix transformation <m>T</m> defined by
    <m>T(\vx) = A \vx</m> always maps the zero vector to the zero vector,
    for <m>T</m> to be one-to-one it must be the case that the zero vector is the only vector that <m>T</m> maps to the zero vector.
    This means that the null space of <m>A</m> must be <m>\{\vzero\}</m>.
    <xref ref="act_3_b_1">Activity</xref>
    demonstrates that if the matrix <m>A</m> that defines the transformation <m>T</m> has a pivot in every column,
    then <m>T(\vx) = \vb</m> will have exactly one solution for each <m>\vb</m> in the range of <m>T</m>.
    So a trivial null space is enough to characterize a one-to-one matrix transformation.
