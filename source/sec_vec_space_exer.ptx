        The definition of a vector space only states the existence of a zero vector and does not say how many zero vectors the space might have.
        In this exercise we show that the zero vector in a vector space is unique.
        To show that the zero vector is unique,
        we assume that two vectors <m>\vzero_1</m> and
        <m>\vzero_2</m> have the zero vector property.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        The definition of a vector space only states the existence of an additive inverse for each vector in the space,
        but does not say how many additive inverses a vector can have.
        In this exercise we show that the additive inverse of a vector in a vector space is unique.
        To show that a vector <m>\vv</m> has only one additive inverse,
        we suppose that <m>\vv</m> has two additive inverses,
        <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vw</m>, and demonstrate that <m>\vu = \vw</m>.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>V</m> be a vector space and <m>\vv</m> a vector in <m>V</m>.
        In all of the vector spaces we have seen to date,
        the additive inverse of the vector <m>\vv</m> is equal to the scalar multiple <m>(-1)\vv</m>.
        This seems reasonable,
        but it is important to note that this result is not stated in the definition of a vector space,
        so this it is something that we need to verify.
        To show that <m>(-1)\vv</m> is an additive inverse of the vector <m>\vv</m>,
        we need to demonstrate that
        <me>
          \vv + (-1)\vv = \vzero
        </me>.
        Verify this equation,
        explicitly stating which properties you use at each step.

        It is reasonable to expect that if <m>c</m> is any scalar and <m>\vzero</m> is the zero vector in a vector space <m>V</m>,
