    We learned about eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix in this section.

          A scalar <m>\lambda</m> is an eigenvalue
          (or characteristic value)
          of a square matrix <m>A</m> if there is a non-zero vector <m>\vx</m> so that 
          <m>A\vx = \lambda \vx</m>.
        </p>

          A non-zero vector <m>\vx</m> is an eigenvector
          (or characteristic vector)
          of a square matrix <m>A</m> if there is a scalar <m>\lambda</m> so that 
          <m>A\vx = \lambda \vx</m>.

          To find the eigenvectors of an
          <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> corresponding to an eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m>,
          we determine the non-trivial solutions to
          <m>(A - \lambda I_n)\vx=\vzero</m> where <m>I_n</m> is the <m>n\times n</m> 
          identity matrix.

          We study eigenvectors and eigenvalues because the eigenvectors tell us 
          quite a bit about the transformation corresponding to the matrix.
          These eigenvectors arise in many applications in physics,
          chemistry, statistics, economics,
          biology, sociology and other areas,
          and help understand the long-term behavior of dynamical systems.

          A dynamical system is a system of variables whose values change with time.
          In linear dynamical systems,
          the change in the state vector from one time period to the next is expressed by 
          matrix multiplication by the transition matrix <m>A</m>.
          The eigenvectors of <m>A</m> provide us a simple method to express the state 
          vector at any given time period in terms of the initial state vector.
          Specifically,
          if the initial state vector is <m>\vx_0=a\vv_0+b\vw_0</m> where
          <m>\vv_0, \vw_0</m> are eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues 
          <m>\lambda_1, \lambda_2</m>, we have
          <me>
            \vx_k = A^k \vx_0 = \lambda_1^k a \vv_0 + \lambda_2^k b \vw_0\,
          </me>.
