  <title>The Geometry of Solution Sets of Linear Systems</title>
  <p>
    We are familiar with linear equations in two variables from basic algebra and calculus
    (through linear approximations).
    The set of solutions to a system of linear equations in two variables has some geometry connected 
    to it.

        Consider the linear equation <m>2x_1-2x_2=2</m>
        (or, equivalently <m>2x-2y=2</m>).
        What is the graph of the solution set (the set of points
        <m>(x_1, x_2)</m> satisfying this equation) of this single equation in the plane?
        Draw the graph to illustrate.

        How can we represent the solution set of the system <xref ref="eq_1_a_2"/> of two equations graphically?
        How is this solution set related to the solution set of the single equation <m>2x_1-2x_2=2</m>?
        Why?
        How many solutions does the system <xref ref="eq_1_a_2"/> have?

        There are exactly three possibilities for the number of solutions to a general system of two 
        linear equations in two unknowns.
        Describe the geometric representations of solution sets for each of the possibilities.
        Illustrate each with a specific example
        (of your own)
        using a system of equations and sketching its geometric representation.

    shows that there are three options for the solution set of a system: A system can have no solutions,
    one solution, or infinitely many solutions.

    Now we consider systems of three variables.
    As an example,
    let us look at the linear equation <m>x+y+z=1</m> in the three variables <m>x</m>,
    <m>y</m>,
    and <m>z</m>.
    Notice that the points <m>(1,1,-2)</m>,
    <m>(0,0,0)</m>, and <m>(-1,-1,2)</m> all satisfy this equation.
    As a linear equation,
    the graph of <m>x+y+z=0</m> will be a plane in three dimensions that contains these three points,
    as shown in <xref ref="F_1_a_plane"></xref>.
    Hence when we consider a linear system in three unknowns,
    we are looking for a point in the three dimensional space that lies on all the planes described 
    by the equations.

      In this activity we examine the geometry of linear systems of three equations in three unknowns.
      Recall that each linear equation in three variables has a plane as its solution set.
      Use a piece of paper to represent each plane.

           Is it possible for a general system of three linear equations in three unknowns to have no

            If so, geometrically describe this situation and then illustrate each with a specific
