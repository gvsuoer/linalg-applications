    In <xref ref="chap_coordinate_vectors"></xref>
    we defined the coordinate vector of a vector <m>\vx</m> in <m>\R^n</m> with respect to a basis
    <m>\CB = \vv_1, \vv_2, \vv_n\}</m> of <m>\R^n</m> to be the vector <m>[x_1 \ x_2 \ \ldots \ x_n]^{\tr}</m> if
    <me>
      \vx = x_1 \vv_1 + x_2 \vv_2 + \cdots + x_n \vv_n
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can define coordinate vectors in vector spaces in the same way.
    As we will see,
    this is a powerful idea as it allows us to translate problems in finite dimensional vector spaces to problems in <m>\R^n</m> where we have many tools at our disposal.
    First we define a coordinate vector.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\CB = \{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_n\}</m> be an ordered basis for a vector space <m>V</m>.
        For any vector <m>\vx</m> in <m>V</m>,
        the <term>coordinate vector</term> of <m>\vx</m> with respect to <m>\CB</m> is the vector
        <me>
          [\vx]_{\CB} = \left[ \begin{array}{c} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \vdots \\ x_n \end{array}  \right]
        </me>,
        where
        <me>
          \vx = x_1 \vv_1 + x_2 \vv_2 + \cdots + x_n \vv_n
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scalars <m>x_1</m>, <m>x_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
        <m>x_n</m> are the <term>coordinates of the vector</term> <m>\vx</m>
        <term>with respect to the basis</term>.

            What specific property does a basis have that ensures the responses to parts (c) and (d) will always be the same?

  <p>
    Recall that there is exactly one way to write a vector as a linear combination of basis vectors,
    so there is only one coordinate vector of a given vector with respect to a basis.
    Therefore, the coordinate vector of any vector is well-defined.
