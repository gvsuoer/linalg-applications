        A vector space is a set <m>V</m> with operations of addition and scalar multiplication defined on <m>V</m> such that for all <m>\vu</m>,
        <m>\vv</m>,
        and <m>\vw</m> in <m>V</m> and all scalars <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>:

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\vu + \vv</m> is an element of <m>V</m> (we say that <m>V</m> is <term>closed</term>
              under the addition in <m>V</m>),
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\vu + \vv = \vv + \vu</m> (we say that the addition in <m>V</m> is <term>commutative</term>),
            </p>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>(\vu + \vv) + \vw = \vu + (\vv + \vw)</m> (we say that the addition in <m>V</m> is <term>associative</term>),

          <li>

              there is a vector <m>\vzero</m> in <m>V</m> so that

              for each <m>\vx</m> in <m>V</m> there is an element <m>\vy</m> in <m>V</m> so that

              <m>\vy</m> for each element <m>\vx</m> in <m>V</m>),

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>a \vu</m> is an element of <m>V</m> (we say that <m>V</m> is <term>closed</term>
              under multiplication by scalars),

            <p>
              <m>(a+b) \vu = a\vu + b\vu</m> (we say that
              <term>multiplication by scalars distributes over scalar addition</term>),
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>a(\vu + \vv) = a\vu + a\vv</m> (we say that

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>(ab) \vu = a(b\vu)</m>,
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>

        For every <m>n</m>, <m>\R^n</m> is a vector space.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A subset <m>W</m> of <m>\R^n</m> is a subspace of <m>\R^n</m> if <m>W</m> is a vector space using the same operations as in <m>\R^n</m>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        To show that a subset <m>W</m> of <m>\R^n</m> is a subspace of <m>\R^n</m>,
        we need to prove the following:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\vu + \vv</m> is in <m>W</m> whenever <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> are in <m>W</m> (when this property is satisfied we say that <m>W</m> is
              <term>closed</term> under addition),
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>a \vu</m> is in <m>W</m> whenever <m>a</m> is a scalar and <m>\vu</m> is in <m>W</m> (when this property is satisfied we say that <m>W</m> is <term>closed</term>
              under multiplication by scalars),
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\vzero</m> is in <m>W</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      
      The remaining properties of a vector space are properties of the operation,
      and as long as we use the same operations as in <m>\R^n</m>, the operation properties follow the operations.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The span of any set of vectors in <m>\R^n</m> is a subspace of <m>\R^n</m>.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
