  <p>
    Suppose we were to film an experiment involving a ball that is bouncing up and down.
    Naively, we set up several cameras to follow the process of the experiment from different perspectives and collect the data.
    All of this data tells us something about the bouncing ball,
    but there may be no perspective that tells us an important piece of information <mdash/> the axis along which the ball bounces.
    The question, then,
    is how we can extract from the data this important piece of information.
    Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a tool for just this type of analysis.

    We will use an example to illustrate important concepts we will need.
    To realistically apply PCA we will have much more data than this,
    but for now we will restrict ourselves to only two variables so that we can visualize our results.
    <xref ref="T_PCA_SAT_2"></xref>
    presents information from ten states on two attributes related to the SAT <mdash/> Evidence-Based Reading and Writing (EBRW) score and Math score.
    The SAT is made up of three sections: Reading, Writing and Language
    (also just called Writing),
    and Math.
    The The EBRW score is calculated by combining the Reading and Writing section scores <mdash/> both the Math and EBRW are scored on a scale of 200-800.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each attribute (Math, EBRW score) creates a vector whose entries are the student responses for that attribute.
    The data provides the average scores from participating students in each state.
    In this example we have two attribute vectors:
    <md>
      <mrow>\vx_1 \amp = [595 \ 540 \ 522 \ 508 \ 565 \ 512 \ 643 \ 574 \ 534 \ 539]^{\tr} \text{ and }</mrow>
      <mrow>\vx_2 \amp = [571 \ 536 \ 493 \ 493 \ 554 \ 501 \ 655 \ 566 \ 534 \ 539]^{\tr}</mrow>
    </md>.
  </p>
  <p>
    These vectors form the rows of a <m>2 \times 10</m> matrix
    <me>
      X_0 = \left[ \begin{array}{c} \vx_1^{\tr} \\ \vx_2^{\tr} \end{array}  \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{cccccccccc}  595\amp 540\amp 522\amp 508\amp 565\amp 512\amp 643\amp 574\amp 534\amp 539 \\ 571\amp 536\amp 493\amp 493\amp 554\amp 501\amp 655\amp 566\amp 534\amp 539 \end{array}  \right]
    </me>
    that makes up our data set.
    A plot of the data is shown at left in <xref ref="F_PCA_data_plot"></xref>,
    where the EBRW score is along the horizontal axis and the math score is along the vertical axis.

    The question we want to answer is,
    how do we represent our data set so that the most important features in the data set are revealed?

  <project xml:id="act_PCA_centering">
    <introduction>
    <p>
      Before analyzing a data set there is often some initial preparation that needs to be made.
      Issues that have to be dealt with include the problem that attributes might have different units and scales.
      For example, in a data set with attributes about people,
      height could be measured in inches while weight is measured in pounds.
      It is difficult to compare variables when they are on different scales.
      Another issue to consider is that some attributes are independent of the others (height,
      for example does not depend on hair color),
      while some are interrelated
      (body mass index depends on height and weight).
      To simplify our work, we will not address these type of problems.
      The only preparation we will do with our data is to center it.
    </p>
  </introduction>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            An important piece of information about a one-dimensional data set
            <m>\vx = [x_1 \ x_2 \ x_3 \ \cdots \ x_n]^{\tr}</m>  is the sample average or mean
            <me>
              \overline{\vx} = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i
            </me>.
            Calculate the means <m>\overline{\vx_1}</m> and
            <m>\overline{\vx_2}</m> for our SAT data from the matrix <m>X_0</m>.

      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            We can use these sample means to center our data at the origin by translating the data so that each column of our data matrix has mean <m>0</m>.
            We do this by subtracting the mean for that row vector from each component of the vector.
            Determine the matrix <m>X</m> that contains the centered data for our SAT data set from matrix <m>X_0</m>.

    A plot of the centered data for our SAT data is shown at right in <xref ref="F_PCA_data_plot"></xref>.
    Later we will see why centering the data is useful <mdash/> it will more easily allow us to project onto subspaces.
    The goal of PCA is to find a matrix <m>P</m> so that <m>PX = Y</m>,
    and <m>Y</m> is suitably transformed to identify the important aspects of the data.
    We will discuss what the important aspects are shortly.
    Before we do so,
    we need to discuss a way to compare the one dimensional data vectors <m>\vx_1</m> and <m>\vx_2</m>.
  </p>

  <project xml:id="act_PCA_covariance">
    <introduction>
    <p>
      To compare the two one dimensional data vectors,
      we need to consider variance and covariance.
    </p>
    </introduction>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            It is often useful to know how spread out a data set is,
            something the average doesn't tell us.
            For example, the data sets <m>[1 \ 2 \ 3]^{\tr}</m> and
            <m>[-2 \ 0 \ 8]^{\tr}</m> both have averages of <m>2</m>,
            but the data in <m>[-2 \ 0 \ 8]^{\tr}</m> is more spread out.
            Variance provides one measure of how spread out a one-dimensional data set <m>\vx = [x_1 \ x_2 \ x_3 \ \cdots \ x_n]^{\tr}</m> is.
            Variance is defined as
            <me>
              \var(\vx) = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left(x_i - \overline{\vx} \right)^2
            </me>.
            The variance provides a measure of how far from the average the data is spread.<fn>
            It might seem that we should divide by <m>n</m> instead of <m>n-1</m> in the variance,
            but it is generally accepted to do this for reasons we won't get into.
            Suffice it to say that if we are using a sample of the entire population,
            then dividing by <m>n-1</m> provides a variance whose square root is closer to the standard deviation than we would get if we divide by <m>n</m>.
            If we are calculating the variance of an entire population,
            then we would divide by <m>n</m>.
            </fn>  Determine the variances of the two data vectors <m>\vx_1</m> and <m>\vx_2</m>.
            Which is more spread out?

          <p>
            In general, we will have more than one-dimensional data,
            as in our SAT data set.
            It will be helpful to have a way to compare one-dimensional data sets to try to capture the idea of variance for different data sets <mdash/> how much the data in two different data sets varies from the mean with respect to each other.
            One such measure is covariance <mdash/> essentially the average of all corresponding products of deviations from the means.
            We define the covariance of two data vectors
            <m>\vx = [x_1 \ x_2 \ \cdots \ x_n]^{\tr}</m> and <m>\vy = [y_1 \ y_2 \ \cdots \ y_n]^{\tr}</m> as
            <me>
              \cov(\vx,\vy) = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left(x_i-\overline{\vx}\right)\left(y_i-\overline{\vy}\right)
            </me>.
            Determine all covariances
            <me>
              \cov(\vx_1,\vx_1), \  \cov(\vx_1,\vx_2), \  \cov(\vx_2,\vx_1), \ \text{ and }  \ \cov(\vx_2,\vx_2)
            </me>.
            How are <m>\cov(\vx_1,\vx_2)</m> and <m>\cov(\vx_2,\vx_1)</m> related?
            How are  <m>\cov(\vx_1,\vx_1)</m> and
            <m>\cov(\vx_2,\vx_2)</m> related to variances?
          </p>

      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            What is most important about covariance is its sign.
            Suppose <m>\vy = [y_1 \ y_2 \ \ldots \ y_n]^{\tr}</m>,
            <m>\vz = [z_1 \ z_2 \ \ldots \ z_n]^{\tr}</m> and <m>\cov(\vy,\vz) > 0</m>.
            Then if <m>y_i</m> is larger than <m>y_j</m> it is likely that <m>z_i</m> is also larger than <m>z_j</m>.
            For example,
            if <m>\vy</m> is a vector that records a persons height from age <m>2</m> to <m>10</m> and <m>\vz</m> records that same person's weight in the same years,
            we might expect that when <m>y_i</m> increases so does <m>z_i</m>.
            Similarly, if <m>\cov(\vy,\vz) \lt 0</m>,
            then as one data set increases, the other decreases.
            As an example,
            if <m>\vy</m> records the number of hours a student spends playing video games each semester ad <m>\vz</m> gives the student's GPA for each semester,
            then we might expect that <m>z_i</m> decreases as <m>y_i</m> increases.
            When <m>\cov(\vy,\vz) = 0</m>,
            then <m>\vy</m> and <m>\vz</m> are said to be uncorrelated or independent of each other.
            For our example <m>\vx_1</m> and <m>\vx_2</m>,
            what does <m>\cov(\vx_1,\vx_2)</m> tell us about the relationship between <m>\vx_1</m> and <m>\vx_2</m>?
            Why should we expect this from the context?

      <idx><h>covariance matrix</h></idx>
        <statement>
          <p>
            The covariance gives us information about the relationships between the attributes.
            So instead of working with the original data,
            we work with the covariance data.
            If we have <m>m</m> data vectors <m>\vx_1</m>,
            <m>\vx_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
            <m>\vx_m</m> in <m>\R^n</m>, the
            <term>covariance matrix</term>
            <m>C = [c_{ij}]</m> satisfies <m>c_{ij} = \cov(\vx_i, \vx_j)</m>.
            Calculate the covariance matrix for our SAT data.
            Then explain why <m>C = \frac{1}{n-1}XX^{\tr}</m>.

  <p>
    Recall that the goal of PCA is to find a matrix <m>P</m> such that <m>PX = Y</m> where <m>P</m> transforms the data set to a coordinate system in which the important aspects of the data are revealed.
    We are now in a position to discuss what that means.
  </p>
  <p>
    An ideal view of our data would be one in which we can see the direction of greatest variance and one that minimizes redundancy.
    With redundant data the variables are not independent <mdash/> that is,
    covariance is nonzero.
    So we would like the covariances to all be zero
    (or as close to zero as possible)
    to remove redundancy in our data.
    That means that we would like a covariance matrix in which the non-diagonal entries are all zero.
    This will be possible if the covariance matrix is diagonalizable.
  </p>

  <project xml:id="act_PCA_diagonalize">
    <statement>
    <p>
      Consider the covariance matrix <m>C = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 1760.18\amp 1967.62\\ 1967.62\amp 2319.29 \end{array} \right]</m>.
      Explain why we can find a matrix <m>P</m> with determinant 1 whose columns are unit vectors that diagonalizes <m>C</m>.
      Then find such a matrix.
      Use technology as appropriate.
    </p>
    </statement>
  </project>

  <p>
    For our purposes, we want to diagonalize
    <m>XX^{\tr}</m> with <m>PXX^{\tr}P^{-1}</m>,
    so the matrix <m>P</m> that serve our purposes is the one whose <em>rows</em>
    are the eigenvectors of <m>XX^{\tr}</m>.
    To understand why this matrix is the one we want,
    recall that we want to have <m>PX = Y</m>,
    and we want to diagonalize
    <m>XX^{\tr}</m> to a diagonal covariance matrix <m>YY^{\tr}</m>.
    In this situation we will have (recalling that <m>P^{-1}=P^{\tr}</m>)
    <me>
      \frac{1}{n-1}YY^{\tr} = \frac{1}{n-1}(PX)(PX)^{\tr} = \frac{1}{n-1}P\left(XX^{\tr}\right)P^{\tr} = P\left(XX^{\tr}\right)P^{-1}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    So the matrix <m>P</m> that we want is exactly the one that diagonalizes <m>XX^{\tr}</m>.
  </p>

  <project xml:id="act_PCA_max_min">
    <introduction>
    <p>
      There are two useful ways we can interpret the results of our work so far.
      An eigenvector of <m>XX^{\tr}</m> that corresponds to the largest
      (also called the <em>dominant</em>)
      eigenvalue <m>\lambda_1</m> is <m>[0.66 \ 0.76]^{\tr}</m>.
      A plot of the centered data along with the eigenspace
      <m>E_{\lambda_1}</m> of <m>XX^{\tr}</m> spanned by
      <m>\vv_1 = [0.66 \ 0.76]^{\tr}</m> is shown at left in <xref ref="F_PCA_pc"></xref>.
      The eigenvector <m>\vv_1</m> is called the
      <term>first principal component</term> of <m>X</m>.
      Notice that this line <m>E_{\lambda_1}</m> indicates the direction of greatest variation in the data.
      That is, the sum of the squares of the differences between the data points and the mean is as large as possible in this direction.
      In other words,
      when we project the data points onto <m>E_{\lambda_1}</m>,
      as shown at right in <xref ref="F_PCA_pc"></xref>,
      the variation of the resulting points is larger than it is for any other line.
      In other words, the data is most spread out in this direction.
    </p>
    </introduction>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            There is another way we can interpret this result.
            If we drop a perpendicular from one of our data points to the space
            <m>E_{\lambda_1}</m> it creates a right triangle with sides of length <m>a</m>,
            <m>b</m>,
            and <m>c</m> as illustrated in the middle of <xref ref="F_PCA_pc"></xref>.
            Use this idea to explain why maximizing the variation also minimizes the sum of the squares of the distances from the data points to this line.
            As a result,
            we have projected our two-dimensional data onto the one-dimensional space that maximizes the variance of the data.

  <p>
    The result of <xref ref="act_PCA_max_min"></xref>
    is that we have reduced the problem from considering the data in a two-dimensional space to a one-dimensional space
    <m>E_{\lambda_1}</m> where the most important aspect of the data is revealed.
    Of course, we eliminate some of the characteristics of the data,
    but the most important aspect is still included and highlighted.
    This is one of the important uses of PCA, data dimension reduction,
    which allows us to reveal key relationships between the variables that might not be evident when looking at a large dataset.
  </p>
  <p>
    The second eigenvector of <m>XX^{\tr}</m> also has meaning.
    A picture of the eigenspace
    <m>E_{\lambda_2}</m> corresponding to the smaller eigenvector <m>\lambda_2</m> of
    <m>XX^{\tr}</m> is shown in <xref ref="F_PCA_second_pc"></xref>.
    The second eigenvector of <m>XX^{\tr}</m> is orthogonal to the first,
    and the direction of the second eigenvector tells us the direction of the second most amount of variance as can be seen in <xref ref="F_PCA_second_pc"></xref>.

  <figure xml:id="F_PCA_second_pc">
    <caption>The second principal component.</caption>
    <image width="50%" source="PCA_second"/>
  </figure>

  <p>
    To summarize, the unit eigenvector for the largest eigenvalue of
    <m>XX^{\tr}</m> indicates the direction in which the data has the greatest variance.
    The direction of the unit eigenvector for the smaller eigenvalue shows the direction in which the data has the second largest variance.
    This direction is also perpendicular to the first
    (indicating <m>0</m> covariance).
    The directions of the eigenvectors are called the
    <term>principal components</term> of <m>X</m>.
    The eigenvector with the highest eigenvalue is the first principal component of the data set and the other eigenvectors are ordered by the eigenvalues,
    highest to lowest.
    The principal components provide a new coordinate system from which to view our data <mdash/> one in which we can see the maximum variance and in which there is zero covariance.

      Notice that the points along the <m>x</m>-axis at right in <xref ref="F_PCA_P"></xref>
      are exactly the numbers in the first row of <m>Y</m>.
      These numbers provide the projections of the data in <m>Y</m> onto the <m>x</m>-axis <mdash/> the axis along which the data has its greatest variance.

        <p>
          Start with a set of data that forms the rows of an <m>m \times n</m> matrix.

      <li>
        <p>
          The principal components of <m>X</m> are the eigenvectors of <m>XX^{\tr}</m>,

          How much variation is accounted for in the data by the first two principal components?

  <p>
    We conclude with a comment.
    A reasonable question to ask is how we interpret the principal components.
    Let <m>P</m> be an orthogonal matrix such that
    <m>PCP^{\tr}</m> is the diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues of <m>C</m> along the diagonal,
    in decreasing order.
    We then have the new perspective <m>Y = PX</m> from which to view the data.
    The first principal component <m>\vp_1</m>
    (the first row of <m>P</m>)
    determines the new variable <m>\vy_1 = [y_i]</m>
    (the first row of <m>Y</m>)
    in the following manner.
    Let <m>\vp_1 = [p_i]^{\tr}</m> and let <m>\vc_i</m> represent the columns of <m>X</m> so that <m>X = [\vc_1 \ \vc_2 \ \vc_3 \ \cdots \ \vc_{20}]</m>.
    Recognizing that
    <me>
      PX =  \left[  \begin{array}{c} \vp_1^{\tr} \\ \vp_2^{\tr} \\ \vp_3^{\tr} \\ \vp_4^{\tr} \\\vp_5^{\tr} \\ \vp_6^{\tr} \end{array}  \right]  [\vc_1 \ \vc_2 \ \vc_3 \ \cdots \ \vc_{20}]
    </me>,
    we have that
    <me>
      y_i = \vp_1^{\tr} \vc_i
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    That is,
    <me>
      \vy_1 = [\vp_1^{\tr}\vc_1 \ \vp_1^{\tr} \vc_2 \ \vp_1^{\tr} \vc_3 \ \cdots \ \vp_{1}^{\tr} \vc_{20}]
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    So each <m>y_i</m> is a linear combination of the original variables
    (contained in the <m>\vc_i</m>)
    with weights from the first principal component.
    The other new variables are obtained in the same way from the remaining principal components.
    So even though the principal components may not have an easy interpretation in context,
    they are connected to the original data in this way.
    By reducing the data to a few important principal components <mdash/> that is,
    visualizing the data in a subspace of small dimension <mdash/> we can account for almost all of the variation in the data and relate that information back to the original data.
