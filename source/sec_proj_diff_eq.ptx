  <title>Project: Linear Transformations and Differential Equations</title>
  <p>
    There are many different types of differential equations,
    but we will focus on differential equations of the form
    <m>my'' = -ky-by'</m> presented in the introduction, a second order
    (the highest derivative in the equation is a second order derivative)
    linear
    (the coefficients are constants)
    differential equation
    (also called damped harmonic oscillators).
  </p>
  <p>
    To solve a differential equation means to find all solutions to the differential equation.
    That is, find all functions <m>y</m> that satisfy the differential equation.
    For example, since <m>\frac{d}{dt} t^2 = 2t</m>,
    we see that <m>y = t^2</m> satisfies the differential equation <m>y' = 2t</m>.
    But <m>t^2</m> is not the only solution to this differential equation.
    In fact, <m>y = t^2 + C</m> is a solution to <m>y' = 2t</m> for any scalar <m>C</m>.
    We will see how to represent solutions to the differential equation <m>my'' = -ky-by'</m> in this project.
  </p>
  <p>
    The next activity shows that the set of solutions to the linear differential equation
    <m>my'' = -ky-by'</m> is a subspace of the vector space <m>\F</m> of all functions from <m>\R</m> to <m>\R</m>.
    So we should expect close connections between differential equations and linear algebra,
    and we will make some of these connections as we proceed.

      We can represent differential equations using linear transformations.
      To see how, let <m>D</m> be the function from the space <m>C^1</m> of all differentiable real-valued functions to <m>\F</m> given by <m>D(f)  = \frac{df}{dt}</m>.
      <ul>

            Show that <m>D</m> is a linear transformation.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In order for a function <m>f</m> to be a solution to a differential equation of the form <xref ref="eq_de_1"/>,
            it is necessary for <m>f</m> to be twice differentiable.
            We will assume that <m>D</m> acts only on such functions from this point on.
            Use the fact that <m>D</m> is a linear transformation to show that the differential equation
            <m>my'' = -ky-by'</m> can be written in the form
            <me>
              \left(mD^2 + bD \right)(y) = -ky
            </me>.

    Project <xref ref="act_de_operator">Activity</xref>
    shows that any solution to the differential equation
    <m>my'' = -ky-by'</m> is an eigenvector for the linear transformation <m>mD^2 + bD</m>.
    That is, the solutions to the differential equation
    <m>my'' = -ky-by'</m> form the eigenspace <m>E_{-k}</m> of
    <m>mD^2 + bD</m> with eigenvalue <m>-k</m>.
    The eigenvectors for a linear transformation acting on a function space are also called
    <em>eigenfunctions</em>.
    To build up to solutions to the second order differential equation we have been considering,
    we start with solutions to the first order equation.

    Before considering the general second order differential equation,
    we start with a simpler example.
  </p>
  <activity xml:id="act_de_Hooke">
    <p>
      As a specific example of a second order linear equation,
      as discussed at the beginning of this section, Hooke's law states that if a mass is hanging from a spring,
      the force acting on the spring is proportional to the displacement of the spring from equilibrium.
      If we let <m>y</m> be the displacement of the object from its equilibrium,
      and ignore any resistance,
      the position of the mass-spring system can be represented by the differential equation
      <me>
        mD^2(y) = -ky
      </me>,
      where <m>m</m> is the mass of the object and <m>k</m> is a positive constant that depends on the spring.
      Assuming that the mass is positive,
      we can divide both sides by <m>m</m> and rewrite this differential equation in the form
      <men xml:id="eq_de_Hooke">
        D^2(y) = -cy
      </men>
      where <m>c = \frac{k}{m}</m>.
      So the solutions to the differential equation <xref ref="eq_de_Hooke"/> make up the eigenspace <m>E_{-c}</m> for <m>D^2</m> with eigenvalue <m>-c</m>.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Since the derivatives of <m>\sin(t)</m> and <m>\cos(t)</m> are scalar multiples of <m>\sin(t)</m> and <m>\cos(t)</m>,
            it may be reasonable that these make up solutions to <xref ref="eq_de_Hooke"/>.
            Show that <m>y_1 = c\cos(t)</m> and
            <m>y_2 = c\sin(t)</m> are both in <m>E_{-c}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            As functions,
            the cosine and sine are related in many ways (e.g., the Pythagorean Identity).
            An important property for this application is the linear independence of the cosine and sine.
            Show, using the <em>definition</em> of linear independence,
            that the cosine and sine functions are linearly independent in <m>\F</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Part (a) shows that there are at least two different functions in <m>E_{-c}</m>.
            To solve a differential equation is to find all of the solutions to the differential equation.
            In other words,
            we want to completely determine the eigenspace <m>E_{-c}</m>.
            We have already seen that any function <m>y</m> of the form
            <m>y(t) = c_1 \cos(t) + c_2 \sin(t)</m> is a solution to the differential equation <m>mD^2(y) = -ky</m>.
            The theory of linear differential equations tells us that there is a unique solution to
            <m>mD^2(y) = -ky</m> if we specify two initial conditions.
            What this means is that to show that any solution <m>z</m> to the differential equation
            <m>mD^2(y) = -ky</m> with two initial values <m>z(t_0)</m> and <m>z'(t_0)</m> for some scalar <m>t_0</m> is of the form <m>y = c_1 \cos(t) + c_2 \sin(t)</m>,
            we need to verify that there are values of <m>c_1</m> and <m>c_2</m> such that
            <m>y(t_0) = z(t_0)</m> and <m>y'(t_0) = z'(t_0)</m>.
            Here we will use this idea to show that any function in <m>E_{-c}</m> is a linear combination of <m>\cos(t)</m> and <m>\sin(t)</m>.
            That is, that the set <m>\{\cos, \sin\}</m> spans <m>E_{-c}</m>.
            Let <m>y = c_1 \cos(t) + c_2 \sin(t)</m>.
            Show that there are values for <m>c_1</m> and <m>c_2</m> such that
            <me>
              y(0) = z'(0) \ \text{ and }  \ y'(0) = z'(0)
            </me>.
            This result, along with part(b),
            shows that <m>\{\cos, \sin\}</m> is a basis for <m>E_{-c}</m>.
            (Note: That the solutions to differential equation <xref ref="eq_de_Hooke"/> involve sines and cosines models the situation that a mass hanging from a spring will oscillate up and down.)

    As we saw in Project <xref ref="act_de_first_order">Activity</xref>,
    the eigenspace <m>E_{k}</m> of the linear transformation <m>D</m> is one-dimensional.
    The key idea in Project <xref ref="act_de_Hooke">Activity</xref>
    that allowed us to find a basis for the eigenspace of <m>D^2</m> with eigenvalue <m>-c</m> is that <m>\cos</m> and <m>\sin</m> are linearly independent eigenfunctions that span <m>E_{-c}</m>.
    We won't prove this result,
    but the general theory of linear differential equations states that if <m>y_1</m>,
    <m>y_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
    <m>y_n</m> are linearly independent solutions to the <m>n</m>th order linear differential equation
    <me>
      \left(a_nD^n + a_{n-1}D^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1D\right)(y) = -a_0y
    </me>,
    then <m>\{y_1, y_2, \ldots,
    y_n\}</m> is a basis for the eigenspace of the linear transformation
    <m>a_nD^n + a_{n-1}D^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1D</m> with eigenvalue <m>-a_0</m>.
    Any basis for the solution set to a differential equation is called a
    <em>fundamental set of solutions</em>
    for the differential equation.
    Consequently,
    it is important to be able to determine when a set of functions is linearly independent.
    One tool for doing so is the Wronskian,
    which we study in the next activity.

      The solution to the Hooke's Law differential equation in Project <xref ref="act_de_Hooke">Activity</xref>
      indicates that the spring will continue to oscillate forever.
      In reality, we know that this does not happen.
      In the non-ideal case,
      there is always some force (e.g., friction, air resistance,
      a physical damper as in a piston) that acts to dampen the motion of the spring causing the oscillations to die off.
      Damping acts to oppose the motion,
      and we generally assume that the faster an object moves,
      the higher the damping.
      For this reason we assume the damping force is proportional to the velocity.
      That is, the damping force has the form <m>-by'</m> for some positive constant <m>b</m>.
      This produces the differential equation
      <men xml:id="act_de_second">
        my'' + by' + ky = 0
      </men>
      or <m>\left(mD^2+bD\right) = -ky</m>.
      We will find bases for the eigenspace of the linear transformation <m>mD^2+bD</m> with eigenvalue <m>-k</m> in this activity.

            Since derivatives of exponential functions are still exponential functions,
            it seems reasonable to try an exponential function as a solution to <xref ref="act_de_second"/>.
            Show that if <m>y = e^{rt}</m> for some constant <m>r</m> is a solution to <xref ref="act_de_second"/>, then <m>mr^2+br+k = 0</m>.
            The equation <m>mr^2+br+k = 0</m> is the characteristic or auxiliary equation for the differential equation.

            Part (a) shows that our solutions to the differential equation <xref ref="act_de_second"/> are exponential of the form <m>e^{rt}</m>,
            where <m>r</m> is a solution to the auxiliary equation.
            Recall that if we can find two linearly independent solutions to <xref ref="act_de_second"/>,
            then we have found a basis for the eigenspace <m>E_{-k}</m> of <m>mD^2+bD</m> with eigenvalue <m>-k</m>.
            The quadratic equation shows that the roots of the auxiliary equation are

            our basis depends on the types of roots the auxiliary equation has.

                  <m>y_2 = e^{r_2t}</m> are eigenfunctions in <m>E_{-k}</m>.

                  Draw a representative solution to illustrate.
                  (In this case we say that the system is <em>overdamped</em>.
                  These systems can oscillate at most once,

                  Now suppose that we have a repeated real root <m>r</m> to the auxiliary equation.
                  Then there is only one exponential function <m>y_1 = e^{rt}</m> in <m>E_{-k}</m>.
                  In this case,
                  show that <m>y_2 = te^{rt}</m> is also in <m>E_{-k}</m> and that

                  <em>critically damped</em>.
                  These systems behave similar to the overdamped systems in that they do not oscillations.
                  However, if the damping is reduced just a little,
                  the system can oscillate.)

                  We want to work with real valued functions,

                  To resolve this problem,
                  we note that if <m>x</m> is a real number,
                  then <m>e^{ix} = \cos(x) + i \sin(x)</m>.

                  Draw a representative solution to illustrate.
                  (In this case we say that the system is <em>underdamped</em>.
                  These systems typically exhibit some oscillation.)

    Project <xref ref="act_de_Wronskian">Activity</xref>
    tells us that if <m>W(f_1, f_2, \ldots,
    f_n)</m> is not zero, then <m>f_1</m>, <m>f_2</m>,
    <m>\ldots</m>, <m>f_n</m> are linearly independent.
    You might wonder what conclusion we can draw if <m>W(f_1, f_2, \ldots,
    f_n)</m> is zero.

      In this activity we consider the Wronskian of two different pairs of functions.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Calculate <m>W\left(t, 2t\right)</m>.
            Are <m>t</m> and <m>2t</m> linearly independent or dependent?
            Explain.
