  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>
    This section is different than others in that it contains mainly proofs of previously stated results and only a little new material.
    Consequently, there is no application attached to this section.

    We have seen that an important property of the determinant is that it provides an easy criteria for the invertibility of a matrix.
    As a result,
    we obtained an algebraic method for finding the eigenvalues of a matrix,
    using the characteristic equation.
    In this section,
    we will investigate other properties of the determinant related to how elementary row operations change the determinant.
    These properties of the determinant will help us evaluate the determinant in a more efficient way compared to using the cofactor expansion method,
    which is computationally intensive for large <m>n</m> values due to it being a recursive method.
    Finally, we will derive a geometrical interpretation of the determinant.

            We first consider how the determinant changes if we multiply a row of the matrix by a constant.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Let <m>A = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 2\amp 3 \\ 1\amp 4 \end{array} \right]</m>.
                  Pick a few different values for the constant <m>k</m> and compare the determinant of <m>A</m> and that of <m>\left[ \begin{array}{cc} 2k\amp 3k \\ 1\amp 4 \end{array} \right]</m>.
                  What do you conjecture that the effect of multiplying a row by a constant on the determinant is?
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If we want to make sure our conjecture is valid for any <m>2\times 2</m> matrix,
                  we need to show that for <m>A = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} a\amp b\\c\amp d \end{array} \right]</m>,
                  the relationship between <m>\det(A)</m> and the determinant of
                  <m>\left[ \begin{array}{cc} a\cdot k\amp b\cdot k\\c\amp d \end{array} \right]</m> follows our conjecture.
                  We should also check that the relationship between <m>\det(A)</m> and the determinant of
                  <m>\left[ \begin{array}{cc} a\amp b\\c\cdot k\amp d\cdot k \end{array} \right]</m> follows our conjecture.
                  Verify this.

              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Make a similar conjecture for what happens to the determinant when a row of a
                  <m>3\times 3</m> matrix <m>A</m> is multiplied by a constant <m>k</m>,
                  and explain why your conjecture is true using the cofactor expansion definition of the determinant.
                </p>

        <li>
          <p>
            The second type of elementary row operation we consider is row swapping.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Take a general <m>2\times 2</m> matrix
                  <m>A = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} a\amp b\\c\amp d \end{array} \right]</m> and determine how row swapping effects the determinant.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Now choose a few different
                  <m>3\times 3</m> matrices and see how row swapping changes the determinant in these matrices by evaluating the determinant with a calculator or any other appropriate technology.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Based on your results so far,
                  conjecture how row swapping changes the determinant in general.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The last type of elementary row operation is adding a multiple of a row to another.
            Determine the effect of this operation on a
            <m>2\times 2</m> matrix by evaluating the determinant of a general
            <m>2\times 2</m> matrix after a multiple of one row is added to the other row.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            All of the elementary row operations we discussed above can be achieved by matrix multiplication with
            <em>elementary matrices</em>.
            For each of the following elementary matrices,
            determine what elementary operation it corresponds to by calculating the product <m>EA</m>,
            where <m>A = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} a_{11}\amp a_{12}\amp a_{13}\\a_{21}\amp a_{22}\amp a_{23}\\a_{31}\amp a_{32}\amp a_{33} \end{array} \right]</m> is a general <m>3\times 3</m> matrix.
