    The singular value decomposition (SVD) of a matrix is an important and useful matrix decomposition.
    Unlike other matrix decompositions,
    <em>every</em> matrix has a singular value decomposition.
    The SVD is used in a variety of applications including scientific computing,
    digital signal processing, image compression,
    principal component analysis,
    web searching through latent semantic indexing, and seismology.
    Recall that the eigenvector decomposition of an
    <m>n \times n</m> diagonalizable matrix <m>M</m> has the form <m>P^{-1}MP</m>,
    where the columns of the matrix <m>P</m> are <m>n</m> linearly independent eigenvectors of <m>M</m> and the diagonal entries of the diagonal matrix
    <m>P^{-1}MP</m> are the eigenvalues of <m>M</m>.
    The singular value decomposition does something similar for any matrix of any size.
    One of the keys to the SVD is that the matrix
    <m>A^{\tr}A</m> is symmetric for any matrix <m>A</m>.
