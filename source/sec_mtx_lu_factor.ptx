  <title>The LU Factorization of a Matrix</title>
  <p>
    There are many instances where we have a number of systems to solve of the form <m>A \vx = \vb</m>,
    all with the same coefficient matrix.
    The system may evolve over time so that we do not know the constant vectors <m>\vb</m> in the system all at once,
    but only determine them as time progresses.
    Each time we obtain a new vector <m>\vb</m>,
    we have to apply the same row operations to reduce the coefficient matrix to solve the new system.
    This is time repetitive and time consuming.
    Instead, we can keep track of the row operations in one row reduction and save ourselves a significant amount of time.
    One way of doing this is the <m>LU</m>-factorization
    (or decomposition).
  </p>
  <p>
    To illustrate,
    suppose we can write the matrix <m>A</m> as a product <m>A = LU</m>, where
    <me>
      L = \left[ \begin{array}{rccc} 1\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0\\-1\amp 1\amp 0\amp 0 \\0\amp 1\amp 1\amp 0\\1\amp 0\amp 0\amp 1 \end{array}   \right] \ \ \text{ and }  \ \ U = \left[ \begin{array}{ccrr} 1\amp 0\amp 1\amp 0\\0\amp 1\amp 3\amp -2 \\0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 3\\0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0 \end{array}   \right]
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let <m>\vb = [3 \ 1 \ 1 \ 3]^{\tr}</m> and <m>\vx = [x_1 \ x_2 \ x_3 \ x_4]^{\tr}</m>,
    and consider the linear system <m>A \vx = \vb</m>.
    If <m>A \vx = \vb</m>, then <m>LU \vx = \vb</m>.
    We can solve this system without applying row operations as follows.
    Let <m>U\vx = \vz</m>, where <m>\vz = [z_1 \ z_2 \ z_3 \ z_4]^{\tr}</m>.
    We can solve <m>L\vz = \vb</m> by using forward substitution.
  </p>
  <p>
    The equation <m>L \vz = \vb</m> is equivalent to the system
    <md>
      <mrow>{5} {}z_1   \  \amp {}  \  \amp {}      \  \amp {} \  \amp {}     \  \amp {} \   \amp {}       \amp = 3</mrow>
      <mrow>{-}z_1  \  \amp {+} \  \amp {}z_2   \  \amp {} \   \amp {}     \  \amp {}  \   \amp {}       \amp = 1</mrow>
      <mrow>{}      \  \amp {}  \  \amp {}z_2   \  \amp {+} \   \amp {}z_3  \   \amp {}  \   \amp {}       \amp = 1</mrow>
      <mrow>{}      \  \amp {}  \  \amp {}      \  \amp {}  \   \amp {}     \   \amp {}  \   \amp {}z_4    \amp = 3</mrow>
    </md>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first equation shows that <m>z_1=3</m>.
    Substituting into the second equation gives us <m>z_2 = 4</m>.
    Using this information in the third equation yields <m>z_3 = -3</m>,
    and then the fourth equation shows that <m>z_4 = 0</m>.
    To return to the original system, since <m>U\vx = \vz</m>,
    we now solve this system to find the solution vector <m>\vx</m>.
    In this case,
    since <m>U</m> is upper triangular, we use back substitution.
    The equation <m>U\vx = \vz</m> is equivalent to the system
    <md>
      <mrow>{5} {}x_1   \  \amp {}  \  \amp {}      \  \amp {+} \  \amp {}x_3   \  \amp {}    \   \amp {}       \amp = \amp {}\amp 3</mrow>
      <mrow>{}      \  \amp {} \  \amp {}x_2   \  \amp {+} \   \amp {3}x_3  \  \amp {-}  \  \amp {2}x_4   \amp = \amp {}\amp 4</mrow>
      <mrow>{}      \  \amp {}  \  \amp {}      \  \amp {}  \   \amp {}      \   \amp {}  \  \amp {3}x_4   \amp = \amp {-}\amp 3</mrow>
    </md>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that the third column of <m>U</m> is not a pivot column,
    so <m>x_3</m> is a free variable.
    The last equation shows that <m>x_4=-1</m>.
    Substituting into the second equation and solving for <m>x_2</m> yields <m>x_2 = 2-3x_3</m>.
    The first equation then gives us <m>x_1 = 3-x_3</m>.
    So the general solution
    <me>
      \vx = \left[ \begin{array}{r} 3\\2\\0\\-1 \end{array}  \right] +  \left[ \begin{array}{r} -1\\-3\\1\\0 \end{array}  \right]x_3
    </me>
    to <m>A \vx = \vb</m> can be found through <m>L</m> and <m>U</m> via forward and backward substitution.
    If we can find a factorization of a matrix <m>A</m> into a lower triangular matrix <m>L</m> and an upper triangular matrix <m>U</m>,
    then <m>A= LU</m> is called an <m>LU</m>-<em>factorization</em>
        <idx><h><m>LU</m> factorization</h></idx>
    or <m>LU</m>-<em>decomposition</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can use elementary matrices to obtain a factorization of certain matrices into products of lower triangular (the
    <q>L</q>
    in LU) and upper triangular (the
    <q>U</q>
    in LU) matrices.
    We illustrate with an example.
    Let
    <me>
      A = \left[ \begin{array}{rccr} 1\amp 0\amp 1\amp 0\\-1\amp 1\amp 2\amp -2 \\0\amp 1\amp 3\amp 1\\1\amp 0\amp 1\amp 0 \end{array}   \right]
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our goal is to find an upper triangular matrix <m>U</m> and a lower triangular matrix <m>L</m> so that <m>A = LU</m>.
    We begin by row reducing <m>A</m> to an upper triangular matrix,
    keeping track of the elementary matrices used to perform the row operations.
    We start by replacing the entries below the <m>(1,1)</m> entry in <m>A</m> with zeros.
    The elementary matrices that perform these operations are
    <me>
      E_1 = \left[ \begin{array}{cccc} 1\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0\\1\amp 1\amp 0\amp 0 \\0\amp 0\amp 1\amp 0\\0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 1 \end{array}   \right] \ \ \text{ and }  \ \ E_2 = \left[ \begin{array}{rccc} 1\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0\\0\amp 1\amp 0\amp 0 \\0\amp 0\amp 1\amp 0\\-1\amp 0\amp 0\amp 1 \end{array}   \right]
    </me>,
    and
    <me>
      E_2E_1A = \left[ \begin{array}{ccrr} 1\amp 0\amp 1\amp 0\\0\amp 1\amp 3\amp -2 \\0\amp 1\amp 3\amp 1\\0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0 \end{array}   \right]
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We next zero out the entries below the <m>(2,2)</m> entry as
    <me>
      E_3E_2E_1A = \left[ \begin{array}{ccrr} 1\amp 0\amp 1\amp 0\\0\amp 1\amp 3\amp -2 \\0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 3\\0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0 \end{array}   \right]
    </me>,
    where
    <me>
      E_3 = \left[ \begin{array}{crcc} 1\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0\\0\amp 1\amp 0\amp 0 \\0\amp -1\amp 1\amp 0\\0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 1 \end{array}   \right]
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The product <m>E_3E_2E_1A</m> is an upper triangular matrix <m>U</m>.
    So we have
    <me>
      E_3E_2E_1A = U
    </me>
    and
    <me>
      A = E_1^{-1}E_2^{-1}E_3^{-1}U
    </me>,
    where
    <me>
      E_1^{-1}E_2^{-1}E_3^{-1} = \left[ \begin{array}{rccc} 1\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0\\-1\amp 1\amp 0\amp 0 \\0\amp 1\amp 1\amp 0\\1\amp 0\amp 0\amp 1 \end{array}   \right]
    </me>
    is a lower triangular matrix <m>L</m>.
    So we have decomposed the matrix <m>A</m> into a product <m>A = LU</m>,
    where <m>L</m> is lower triangular and <m>U</m> is upper triangular.
    Since every matrix is row equivalent to a matrix in row echelon form,
    we can always find an upper triangular matrix <m>U</m> in this way.
    However, we may not always obtain a corresponding lower triangular matrix,
    as the next example illustrates.
  </p>
  <p>
    Suppose we change the problem slightly and consider the matrix
    <me>
      B = \left[ \begin{array}{rccr} 1\amp 0\amp 1\amp 0\\-1\amp 1\amp 2\amp -2 \\0\amp 1\amp 3\amp 1\\1\amp 0\amp 0\amp 1 \end{array}   \right]
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Using the same elementary matrices <m>E_1</m>, <m>E_2</m>,
    and <m>E_3</m> as earlier, we have
    <me>
      E_3E_2E_1B = \left[ \begin{array}{ccrr} 1\amp 0\amp 1\amp 0\\0\amp 1\amp 3\amp -2 \\0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 3\\0\amp 0\amp -1\amp 1 \end{array}   \right]
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    To reduce <m>B</m> to row-echelon form now requires a row interchange.
    Letting
    <me>
      E_4 = \left[ \begin{array}{crcc} 1\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0\\0\amp 1\amp 0\amp 0 \\0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 1\\0\amp 0\amp 1\amp 0 \end{array}   \right]
    </me>
    brings us to
    <me>
      E_4E_3E_2E_1B = \left[ \begin{array}{ccrr} 1\amp 0\amp 1\amp 0\\0\amp 1\amp 3\amp -2 \\0\amp 0\amp -1\amp 1\\0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 3 \end{array}   \right]
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    So in this case we have <m>U = E_4E_3E_2E_1B</m>, but
    <me>
      E_1^{-1}E_2^{-1}E_3^{-1}E_4^{-1} = \left[ \begin{array}{rccc} 1\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0\\-1\amp 1\amp 0\amp 0 \\0\amp 1\amp 0\amp 1\\1\amp 0\amp 1\amp 0 \end{array}   \right]
    </me>
    is not lower triangular.
    The difference in this latter example is that we needed a row swap to obtain the upper triangular form.
