  <title>Elementary Row Operations and Their Effects on the Determinant</title>
  <p>
    In <xref ref="pa_4_f"></xref>,
    we conjectured how elementary row operations affect the determinant of a matrix.
    In the following activity,
    we prove how the determinant changes when a row is multiplied by a constant using the cofactor expansion definition of the determinant.

    <introduction>
    <p>
      In this activity,
      assume that the determinant of <m>A</m> can be determined by a cofactor expansion along any row or column.
      (We will prove this result independently later in this section.)
      Consider an arbitrary <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>A = [a_{ij}]</m>.

            Write the expression for <m>\det(A)</m> using the cofactor expansion along the second row.

            Write the expression for <m>\det(B)</m> if the cofactor expansion along the second row is used.

            Explain how this method generalizes to prove the relationship between the determinant of a matrix <m>A</m> and that of the matrix obtained by multiplying a row by a constant <m>k</m>.

    Your work in <xref ref="act_4_f_1"></xref>
    proves the first part of the following theorem on how elementary row operations change the determinant of a matrix.

  <theorem xml:id="thm_4_f_1">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be a square matrix.
