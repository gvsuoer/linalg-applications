  <p>
    To identify hidden polygons in a surface,
    we will utilize a technique called
    <term>back face culling</term>.
    This involves identifying which polygons are back facing and which are front facing relative to the viewer's perspective.
    The first step is to assign a direction to each polygon in a surface.

    <introduction>
    <p>
      Consider the polygon <m>ABCD</m> in <xref ref="F_Normal_vector"></xref>.
      Since a polygon is flat,
      every vector in the polygon is perpendicular to a fixed vector
      (which we call a <term>normal vector</term> to the polygon).
      A normal vector <m>\vn</m> for the polygon <m>ABCD</m> in <xref ref="F_Normal_vector"></xref> is shown.
      In this activity we learn how to find a normal vector to a polygon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>\vx = [x_1 \ x_2 \ x_3]^{\tr}</m> and
      <m>\vy = [y_1 \ y_2 \ y_3]^{\tr}</m> be two vectors in <m>\R^3</m>.
      If <m>\vx</m> and <m>\vy</m> are linearly independent,
      then <m>\vx</m> and <m>\vy</m> determine a polygon as shown in <xref ref="F_Normal_vector"></xref>.
      Our goal is to find a vector <m>\vn</m> that is orthogonal to both <m>\vx</m> and <m>\vy</m>.
      Let <m>\vw = [w_1 \ w_2 \ w_3]^{\tr}</m> be another vector in <m>\R^3</m> and let
      <m>C = \left[ \begin{array}{c} \vw^{\tr} \\ \vx^{\tr} \\ \vy^{\tr} \end{array}  \right]</m> be the matrix whose rows are <m>\vw</m>,
      <m>\vx</m>, and <m>\vy</m>.
      Let <m>C_{ij}</m> be the <m>ij</m>th cofactor of <m>C</m>,
      that is <m>C_{ij}</m> is <m>(-1)^{i+j}</m> times the determinant of the submatrix of <m>C</m> obtained by deleting the <m>i</m>th row and <m>j</m>th column of <m>C</m>.
      Now define the vector <m>\vx \times \vy</m> as follows:
      <me>
        \vx \times \vy = C_{11}\ve_1 + C_{12}\ve_2 + C_{13} \ve_3
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vector <m>\vx \times \vy</m> is called the <term>cross product</term>
      of the vectors <m>\vx</m> and <m>\vy</m>.
      (Note that the cross product is only defined for vectors in <m>\R^3</m>.)
      We will show that <m>\vx \times \vy</m> is orthogonal to both <m>\vx</m> and <m>\vy</m>,
      making <m>\vx \times \vy</m> a normal vector to the polygon defined by <m>\vx</m> and <m>\vy</m>.

          Explain why <m>\vx \times \vy</m> is orthogonal to both <m>\vx</m> and <m>\vy</m> and is therefore a normal vector to the polygon determined by <m>\vx</m> and <m>\vy</m>.

    <xref ref="act_bf_normal"></xref>
    shows how we can find a normal vector to a parallelogram <mdash/> take two vectors <m>\vx</m> and <m>\vy</m> between the vertices of the parallelogram and calculate their cross products.
    Such a normal vector can define a direction for the parallelogram.
    There is still a problem, however.
  </p>

  <project xml:id="act_bf_normal_2">
    <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>\vx = [x_1 \ x_2 \ x_3]^{\tr}</m> and
      <m>\vy = [y_1 \ y_2 \ y_3]^{\tr}</m> be any vectors in <m>\R^3</m>.
      There is a relationship between
      <m>\vx \times \vy</m> and <m>\vy \times \vx</m>.
      Find and verify this relationship.

  <p>
    <xref ref="act_bf_normal_2"></xref>
    shows that the cross product is anticommutative,
    so we get different directions if we switch the order in which we calculate the cross product.
    To fix a direction,
    we establish the convention that we always label the vertices of our parallelogram in the counterclockwise direction as shown in <xref ref="F_Normal_vector"></xref>.
    This way we always use <m>\vx</m> as the vector from vertex <m>A</m> to vertex <m>B</m> rather than the reverse.
    With this convention established,
    we can now define the direction of a parallelogram as the direction of its normal vector.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once we have a normal vector established for each polygon,
    we can now determine which polygons are back-face and which are front-face.
    <xref ref="F_Hidden"></xref>
    at left provides the gist of the idea,
    where we represent the polygons with line segments to illustrate.
    If the viewer's eye is at point <m>P</m> and views the figures,
    the normal vectors of the visible polygons point in a direction toward the viewer (front-face) and the normal vectors of the polygons hidden from the viewer point away from the viewer
    (back-face).
    What remains is to determine an effective computational way to identify the front and back facing polygons.

      Consider the situation as depicted at right in <xref ref="F_Hidden"></xref>.
      Assume that <m>AB</m> and <m>RS</m> are polygons
      (rendered one dimensionally here)
      with normal vectors <m>\vn</m> at their centers as shown.
      The viewer's eye is at point <m>P</m> and the viewer's line of vision to the centers <m>C_{AB}</m> and <m>C_{RS}</m> are indicated by the vectors <m>\vv</m>.
      Each vector <m>\vv</m> makes an angle <m>\theta</m> with the normal to the polygon.

            The dot product then provides us with a simple computational tool for identifying back-facing polygons
            (assuming we have already calculated all of the normal vectors).
            We can then create an algorithm to cull the back-facing polygons.
            Assuming that we the viewpoint <m>P</m> and the coordinates of the polygons of the surface,
            complete the pseudo-code for a back-face culling algorithm:
          </p>
          <program>
          <input>
          for all polygons on the surface do
            calculate the normal vector n using the ______ product for the current polygon
            calculate the center C of the current polygon
            calculate the viewing vector ______
              if ______ then
                render the current polygon
            end if
          end for
          </input>
          </program>
        </statement>
      </task>
    
  </project>

  <p>
    As a final comment,
    back-face culling generally reduces the number of polygons to be rendered by half.
    This algorithm is not perfect and does not always do what we want it to do (e.g., it may not remove all parts of a polygon that we don't see),
    so there are other algorithms to use in concert with back-face culling to correctly render objects.
