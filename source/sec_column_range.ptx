  <title>The Column Space of a Matrix and the Range of a Matrix Transformation</title>
  <p>
    Given an <m>m \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m>,
    we have seen that the matrix-vector product <m>A \vx</m> is a linear combination of the columns of <m>A</m> with weights from <m>\vx</m>.
    It follows that the equation
    <m>A \vx = \vb</m> has a solution if and only if <m>\vb</m> is a linear combination of the columns of <m>A</m>.
    So the span of the columns of <m>A</m> tells us for which vectors the equation <m>A \vx = \vb</m> is consistent.
    We give the span of the columns of a matrix <m>A</m> a special name.

        The <term>column space</term>
            <idx><h>column space</h></idx>
        of an <m>m \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> is the span of the columns of <m>A</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    We denote the column space of <m>A</m> as <m>\Col A</m>.
    Given that <m>A \vx</m> is a linear combination of the columns of <m>A</m>,
    we can also write the column space of an <m>m \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> as
    <me>
      \Col A = \{A \vx : \vx \text{ is in }  \R^n\}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the matrix transformation <m>T</m> defined by <m>T(\vx) = A\vx</m>,
    the set of all vectors of the form <m>A \vx</m> is also the range of the transformation <m>T</m>.
    So for a matrix transformation <m>T</m> with matrix <m>A</m> we have <m>\Range(T) = \Col A</m>.

      As a span of a set of vectors,
      we know that <m>\Col A</m> is a subspace of <m>\R^k</m> for an appropriate value of <m>k</m>.
      <ul>
        <li>

            Let <m>M = \left[ \begin{array}{ccccr} 1\amp 1\amp 1\amp 0\amp 2 \\ 0\amp 1\amp 0\amp 1\amp 1 \\ 1\amp 0\amp 1\amp 1\amp -1 \\ 0\amp 1\amp 0\amp 1\amp 1 \end{array} \right]</m>.
            The space <m>\Col M</m> is a subspace of <m>\R^k</m> for some positive integer <m>k</m>.
            What is <m>k</m> in this case?

            If <m>A</m> is an <m>m \times n</m> matrix,
            then <m>\Col A</m> is a subspace of <m>\R^k</m> for some positive integer <m>k</m>.
            What is <m>k</m> in this case?

            Recall that a matrix transformation <m>T</m> given by <m>T(\vx)=A\vx</m> where <m>A</m> is an
            <m>m\times n</m> matrix is onto if for every <m>\vb</m> in <m>\R^m</m> there exists a <m>\vx</m> in <m>\R^n</m> for which <m>T(\vx)=\vb</m>.
            How does <m>T</m> being onto relate to the <m>\Col A</m>?

    As you saw in <xref ref="act_3_b_2"></xref>,
    a matrix transformation <m>T</m> defined by
    <m>T(\vx)=A\vx</m> is onto if the column space of <m>A</m>,
    which consists of the image vectors under the transformation <m>T</m>,
    is equal to <m>\R^m</m>.
    In other words, we want the
    <m>\Range(T)</m> to equal <m>\R^m</m>.
