  <title>Complex Eigenvalues</title>
  <p>
    As you noticed in <xref ref="pa_4_e"></xref>,
    the complex roots of the characteristic equation of a real matrix <m>A</m> come in complex conjugate pairs.
    This should come as no surprise since we know through our use of the quadratic formula that complex roots of (real) quadratic polynomials come in complex conjugate pairs.
    More generally,
    if <m>p(x)=a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2 + \cdots + a_nx^n</m> is a polynomial with real coefficients and <m>z</m> is a root of this polynomial,
    meaning <m>p(z)=0</m>, then
    <me>
      0=\overline{p(z)} = \overline{a_0+a_1z+a_2z^2 + \cdots + a_nz^n} = a_0 + a_1 \overline{z} + a_2 \overline{z}^2 + \cdots + a_n \overline{z}^n = p(\overline{z})\,
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, <m>\overline{z}</m> is also a root of <m>p(x)</m>.

      Let <m>A=\left[ \begin{array}{cr} 0\amp -1 \\ 1\amp 0 \end{array} \right]</m>.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The matrix transformation <m>T:\R^2 \to \R^2</m> defined by
            <m>T(\vx)=A\vx</m> is a rotation transformation.
            What is the angle of rotation?

            Find the eigenvalues of <m>A</m>.
            For each eigenvalue, find an eigenvector.

    In <xref ref="pa_4_e"></xref>
    and in <xref ref="act_4e_1"></xref>,
    you found that if <m>\vv</m> is an eigenvector of <m>A</m> corresponding to <m>\lambda</m>,
    then <m>\overline{\vv}</m> obtained by taking the complex conjugate of each entry in <m>\vv</m> is an eigenvector of <m>A</m> corresponding to <m>\overline{\lambda}</m>.
    Specifically,
    if <m>\vv=\vu+i\vw</m> where both <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vw</m> are real vectors is an eigenvector of <m>A</m>,
    then so is <m>\overline{\vv} = \vu-i\vw</m>.
    We can justify this property using matrix algebra as follows:
    <me>
      A\overline{\vv} = \overline{A}\overline{\vv} = \overline{A\vv} = \overline{\lambda \vv} = \overline{\lambda} \overline{\vv} \,
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the first equality,
    we used the fact that <m>A</m> is a real matrix, so <m>\overline{A}=A</m>.
    In all the other equalities,
    we used the properties of the conjugation operation in complex numbers.
