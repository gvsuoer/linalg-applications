        A matrix is just a rectangular array of numbers or objects.

        Given a system of linear equations,
        with the variables listed in the same order in each equation,
        we represent the system by writing the coefficients of the first equation as the first row of a matrix,
        the coefficients of the second equation as the second row,
        and so on.
        This creates the coefficient matrix of the system.
        We then augment the coefficient matrix with a column of the constants that appear in the equations.
        This gives us the augmented matrix of the system.

        The operations that we can perform on equations translate exactly to row operations that we can perform on an augmented matrix:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Replacing one row by the sum of that row and a scalar multiple of another row.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Interchanging two rows.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Replacing a row by a nonzero scalar multiple of itself.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

        The forward elimination phase of the elimination method recursively eliminates the variables in a linear system to reach an equivalent but simplified system.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The first non-zero entry in an equation in a linear system after elimination is called a pivot.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A basic variable in a linear system corresponds to a pivot of the system.
        A free variable is a variable that is not basic.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A linear system can be inconsistent
        (no solutions),
        have a unique solution
        (if consistent and every variable is a basic variable),
        or have infinitely many solutions
        (if consistent and there is a free variable).
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A linear system has no solutions if, after elimination,
        there is an equation of the form <m>0=b</m> where <m>b</m> is a nonzero number.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A linear system after the elimination method can be solved using back-substitution.
        The free variables can be chosen arbitrarily and the basic variables can be solved in terms of the free variables through the back-substitution process.
