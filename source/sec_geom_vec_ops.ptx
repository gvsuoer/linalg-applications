  <title>Geometric Representation of Vectors and Vector Operations</title>
  <p>
    We can geometrically represent a vector
    <m>\vv = \left[ \begin{array}{c} v_1\\ v_2 \end{array} \right]</m> in <m>\R^2</m> as the point
    <m>(v_1, v_2)</m> in the plane as we did in <xref ref="pa_1_d"></xref>.
    We can similarly represent a vector
    <m>\vv = \left[ \begin{array}{c} v_1\\ v_2\\ v_3 \end{array} \right]</m> in <m>\R^3</m> as the point
    <m>(v_1, v_2, v_3)</m> in the three-dimensional space.
    This geometric representation will be handy when we consider collections of infinitely many vectors,
    as we will do when we consider the span of a collection of vectors later in this section.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can also represent the vector
    <m>\vv = \left[ \begin{array}{c} v_1\\ v_2 \end{array} \right]</m> in <m>\R^2</m> as the 
    directed line segment
    (or arrow)
    from the origin to the point
    <m>(v_1, v_2)</m> as shown in <xref ref="F_Vector1"></xref> to aid in the visualization.
  </p>

    <caption>The vector <m> \left[ \begin{array}{c} 4\\ 6 \end{array}  \right]</m> in <m>\R^2</m>.</caption>

  </figure>

  <p>
    The fact that the vector in <xref ref="F_Vector1"></xref>
    is represented by the directed line segment from the origin to the point (4,6) means that 
    this vector is the vector <m>\vv = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 4\\ 6 \end{array}  \right]</m>.
    If <m>O</m> is the origin and <m>P</m> is the point <m>(4,6)</m>,
    we will also denote this vector as <m>\overrightarrow{OP}</m> <mdash/> so
    <me>
      \overrightarrow{OP} = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 4\\ 6 \end{array}  \right]
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
  <idx><h>vector</h><h>length in <m>\R^n</m></h></idx>
    In this way we can think of vectors as having direction and length.
    With the Pythagorean Theorem,
    we can see that the length of a vector
    <m>\vv = \left[ \begin{array}{c} v_1\\v_2 \end{array}  \right]</m> is <m>\sqrt{v_1^2+v_2^2}</m>.
    This idea can be applied to vectors in any space.
    If <m>\vv = \left[ \begin{array}{c} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \\ \vdots \\ \ v_n \end{array}  \right]</m> 
    is a vector in <m>\R^n</m>,
    then the <term>length</term> of <m>\vv</m>,
    denoted <m>|\vv|</m> is the scalar
    <me>
      ||\vv|| = \sqrt{v_1^2+v_2^2+ \cdots + v_n^2}
    </me>.
  </p>

    Thinking of vectors having direction and length is especially useful in visualizing the 
    addition of vectors.
    The geometric interpretation of the sum of two vectors can be seen in 
    <xref ref="F_vector_sum_1"></xref>
    and <xref ref="F_vector_sum_2"></xref>.

  <p>
    Let <m>\vu = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 4\\ 6 \end{array} \right]</m> and 
    <m>\vv = \left[ \begin{array}{r} 3\\ -2 \end{array} \right]</m>.
    Then <m>\vu + \vv = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 7\\ 4 \end{array} \right]</m> as shown in 
    <xref ref="F_vector_sum_1"></xref>.
    <xref ref="F_vector_sum_2"></xref>
    provides a context to interpret this vector sum geometrically.
    Using the parallelogram imposed on the three vectors,
    we see that if vectors <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> are both placed to start at the origin,
    then the vector sum <m>\vu + \vv</m> can be visualized geometrically as the directed line 
    segment from the origin to the fourth corner of the parallelogram.
  </p>
  <p>
    In <xref ref="pa_1_d"></xref>
    we considered scalar multiples of a vector in <m>\R^2</m>.
    The arrow representation helps in visualizing scalar multiples as well.
    Geometrically,
    a scalar multiple <m>c\vv</m> of a nonzero vector <m>\vv</m> is a vector in the same direction 
    as <m>\vv</m> if <m>c>0</m> and in the opposite direction as <m>\vv</m> if <m>c\lt 0</m>.
    If <m>c>1</m>, scalar multiplication stretches the vector,
    while <m>0\lt c\lt 1</m> shrinks the vector.
    We also saw that the collection of all scalar multiples of a vector <m>\vv</m> in <m>\R^2</m> 
    gives us a line through the origin and <m>\vv</m>,
    except when <m>\vv=\vzero</m> in which case we only obtain <m>\vzero</m>.
    In other words, for a nonzero vector <m>\vv</m>,
    the set <m>S = \{c\vv : c \text{ is a scalar } \}</m> is the line through the origin and 
    <m>\vv</m> in <m>\R^2</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    All of these properties generalize to vectors in <m>\R^3</m>.
    Specifically,
    the scalar multiple <m>c\vv</m> is a vector in the same or opposite direction as <m>\vv</m> 
    based on the sign of <m>c</m>,
    and is a stretched or shrunken version of <m>\vv</m> based on whether <m>|c|>1</m> or <m>|c|\lt 1</m>.
    Also, the collection of all multiples of a non-zero vector <m>\vv</m> in <m>\R^3</m> 
    form a line through the origin.
