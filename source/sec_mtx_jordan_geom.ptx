    Recall that we can visualize the action of a matrix transformation defined by a diagonalizable matrix by using a change of basis.
    For example, let <m>T(\vx) = A\vx</m>,
    where <m>A = \frac{1}{3}\left[ \begin{array}{rr} 8\amp -1\\-2\amp 7 \end{array} \right]</m>.
    The eigenvalues of <m>A</m> are <m>\lambda_1 = 3</m> and
    <m>\lambda_2 = 2</m> with corresponding eigenvectors
    <m>\vv_1 = [-1 \ 1]^{\tr}</m> and <m>[1 \ 2]^{\tr}</m>.
    So <m>A</m> is diagonalizable by the matrix <m>P = \left[ \begin{array}{rc} -1\amp 1\\1\amp 2 \end{array} \right]</m>,
    with <m>P^{-1}AP = D = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 3\amp 0\\0\amp 2 \end{array} \right]</m>.
    Note that <m>T(\vx) = PDP^{-1} \vx</m>.
    Now <m>P^{-1}</m> is a change of basis matrix from the standard basis to the basis <m>\CB = \{\vv_1, \vv_2\}</m>,
    and <m>D</m> stretches space in the direction of <m>\vv_1</m> by a factor of 3 and stretches space in the direction of <m>\vv_2</m> by a factor of 2, and then <m>P</m> changes basis back to the standard basis.
    This is illustrated in <xref ref="F_JCF_geometry_1"></xref>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In general, if an <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> is diagonalizable,
    then there is a basis <m>\CB = \{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_n\}</m> of <m>\R^n</m> consisting of eigenvectors of <m>A</m>.
    Assume that <m>A \vv_i = \lambda_i \vv_i</m> for each <m>i</m>.
    Letting <m>P = [\vv_1 \ \vv_2 \ \ldots \ \vv_n]</m> we know that
    <me>
      P^{-1}AP = D
    </me>,
    where <m>D</m> is the diagonal matrix with <m>\lambda_1</m>,
    <m>\lambda_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
    <m>\lambda_n</m> down the diagonal.
    If <m>T</m> is the matrix transformation defined by <m>T(\vx) = A\vx</m>, then
    <me>
      T(\vx) = PDP^{-1} \vx
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now <m>P^{-1}</m> is a change of basis matrix from the standard basis to the basis <m>\CB</m>,
    and <m>D</m> stretches or contracts space in the direction of <m>\vv_i</m> by the factor <m>\lambda_i</m>,
    and then <m>P</m> changes basis back to the standard basis.
    In this way we can visualize the action of the matrix transformation using the basis <m>\CB</m>.
    If <m>A</m> is not a diagonalizable matrix,
    we can use the Jordan canonical form to understand the action of the transformation defined by <m>A</m>.
    We start by analyzing shears.

      Recall from <xref ref="sec_matrix_transformations">Section</xref>
      that a matrix transformation <m>T</m> defined by <m>T(\vx) = A\vx</m>,
      where <m>A</m> is of the form
      <m>\left[ \begin{array}{cc} 1\amp a\\0\amp 1 \end{array}  \right]</m> performs a shear in the <m>x</m> direction,
      as illustrated at left in <xref ref="F_JCF_shear_1"></xref>.
      That is, while <m>T(\ve_1) = \ve_1</m>,
      it is the case that <m>T(\ve_2) = \ve_2 + [a \ 0]^{\tr}</m>.
      In other words,
      <m>T(\ve_2)-\ve_2 = [a \ 0]^{\tr}</m> is in <m>\Span \{\ve_1\}</m>.
      But we can say something more.
      Show that if <m>\vx = [x_1 \ x_2]^{\tr}</m> is not in <m>\Span \{\ve_1\}</m>, then
      <me>
        T(\vx) = \vx + x_2[a \ 0]^{\tr}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result is that if <m>\vx</m> is not in <m>\Span \{\ve_1\}</m>,
      then <m>T(\vx) - \vx</m> is in <m>\Span \{\ve_1\}</m>.
      This leads us to a general definition of a shear.

    As we did with diagonalizable matrices,
    we can understand a general matrix transformation of the form
    <m>T(\vx) = A\vx</m> by using a Jordan canonical form of <m>A</m>.
    In this context, we will encounter matrices of the form
    <m>B = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} c\amp a\\0\amp c \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} c\amp 0 \\ 0\amp c \end{array} \right] \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 1\amp \frac{a}{c} \\ 0\amp 1 \end{array} \right]</m> for some positive constant <m>c</m>.
    If <m>S(\vx) = B\vx</m>,
    then <m>S</m> performs a shear in the direction of <m>\ve_1</m> and then an expansion or contraction in all directions by a factor of <m>c</m>.
    We illustrate with an example.

    provides the essential ideas to understand the geometry of a general linear transformation using the Jordan canonical form.
    Let <m>T(\vx) = A\vx</m> with
    <m>A \vv_1 = \lambda \vv_1</m> and <m>A \vv_2 = \lambda \vv_2 + \vv_1</m>.
    Then <m>T</m> maps <m>\Span \{\vv_1\}</m> to

    and <m>T</m> maps <m>\Span\{\vv_2\}</m> to the line containing the terminal point of <m>\vv_1</m> in the direction of <m>\vv_2</m>.
    The matrix <m>C</m> performs a change of basis from the standard basis to the basis <m>\{\vv_1, \vv_2\}</m>,
    then the matrix <m>\left[ \begin{array}{cc} 2\amp 1\\0\amp 2 \end{array} \right]</m> performs an expansion by a factor of 2 in all directions and a shear in the direction of <m>\vv_1</m>.
