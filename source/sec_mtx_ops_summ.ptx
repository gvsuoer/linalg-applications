  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>
    In this section we defined a matrix sum,
    scalar multiples of matrices,
    the matrix product, and the transpose of a matrix.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The sum of two <m>m \times n</m> matrices
          <m>A = [a_{ij}]</m> and <m>B = [b_{ij}]</m> is the
          <m>m \times n</m> matrix <m>A+B</m> whose <m>i,j</m>th entry is <m>a_{ij} + b_{ij}</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If <m>A = [a_{ij}]</m> is an <m>m \times n</m> matrix,
          the scalar multiple <m>kA</m> of <m>A</m> by the scalar <m>k</m> is the
          <m>m \times n</m> matrix whose <m>i,j</m>th entry is <m>ka_{ij}</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If <m>A</m> is a <m>k \times m</m> matrix and
          <m>B = [\vb_1 \ \vb_2 \ \cdots \ \vb_n]</m> is an <m>m \times n</m> matrix,
          then the matrix product <m>AB</m> of the matrices <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> is the 
          <m>k \times n</m> matrix
          <me>
            [A\vb_1 \ A\vb_2 \ \cdots \ A\vb_n]
          </me>.
          The matrix product is defined in this way so that the matrix of a composite
          <m>S \circ T</m> of linear transformations is the product of matrices of 
          <m>S</m> and <m>T</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          An alternate way of calculating the product of an
          <m>k \times m</m> matrix <m>A</m> with rows <m>\vr_1</m>,
          <m>\vr_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
          <m>\vr_k</m> and an <m>m \times n</m> matrix <m>B</m> with columns <m>\vb_1</m>,
          <m>\vb_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
          <m>\vb_n</m> is that the product <m>AB</m> is the
          <m>k \times n</m> matrix whose <m>i,j</m>th entry is <m>\vr_i \cdot \vb_j</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Matrix multiplication does not behave as the standard multiplication on real numbers.
          For example,
          we can have a product of two non-zero matrices equal to the zero matrix and
          there is no cancellation law for matrix multiplication.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The transpose of an <m>m \times n</m> matrix <m>A = [a_{ij}]</m> is the
          <m>n \times m</m> matrix <m>A^{\tr}</m> whose <m>i,j</m>th entry is <m>a_{ji}</m>.
        </p>

    </ul>
