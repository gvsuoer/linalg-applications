  <title>Project: The Second Derivative Test for Functions of Two Variables</title>
  <p>
    In this project we will verify the Second Derivative Test for functions of two variables.<fn>
    Many thanks to Professor Paul Fishback for sharing his activity on this topic.
    Much of this project comes from his activity.
    </fn> This test will involve Taylor polynomials and linear algebra.
    As a quick review,
    recall that the second order Taylor polynomial for a function <m>f</m> of a single variable <m>x</m> at <m>x = a</m> is
    <men xml:id="eq_Taylor_2">
      P_2(x) = f(a)+f'(a)(x-a)+\frac{f''(a)}{2}(x-a)^2
    </men>.
  </p>
  <p>
    As with the linearization of a function,
    the second order Taylor polynomial is a good approximation to <m>f</m> around <m>a</m> <mdash/> that is
    <m>f(x) \approx P_2(x)</m> for <m>x</m> close to <m>a</m>.
    If <m>a</m> is a critical number for <m>f</m> with <m>f'(a) = 0</m>, then
    <me>
      P_2(x) = f(a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2}(x-a)^2
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this situation, if <m>f''(a) \lt 0</m>,
    then <m>\frac{f''(a)}{2}(x-a)^2 \leq 0</m> for <m>x</m> close to <m>a</m>,
    which makes <m>P_2(x) \leq f(a)</m>.
    This implies that <m>f(x) \approx P_2(x) \leq f(a)</m> for <m>x</m> close to <m>a</m>,
    which makes <m>f(a)</m> a relative maximum value for <m>f</m>.
    Similarly, if <m>f''(a) > 0</m>,
    then <m>f(a)</m> is a relative minimum.
  </p>
  <p>
    We now need a Taylor polynomial for a function of two variables.
    The complication of the additional independent variable in the two variable case means that the Taylor polynomials will need to contain all of the possible monomials of the indicated degrees.
    Recall that the linearization
    (or tangent plane)
    to a function <m>f = f(x,y)</m> at a point <m>(a,b)</m> is given by
    <me>
      P_1(x,y) = f(a,b) + f_x(a,b)(x-a) + f_y(a,b)(y-b)
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that <m>P_1(a,b) = f(a,b)</m>,
    <m>\frac{\partial P_1}{\partial x}(a,b) = f_x(a,b)</m>,
    and <m>\frac{\partial P_1}{\partial y}(a,b) = f_y(a,b)</m>.
    This makes <m>P_1(x,y)</m> the best linear approximation to <m>f</m> near the point <m>(a,b)</m>.
    The polynomial <m>P_1(x,y)</m> is the first order Taylor polynomial for <m>f</m> at <m>(a,b)</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Similarly, the second order Taylor polynomial
    <m>P_2(x,y)</m> centered at the point <m>(a,b)</m> for the function <m>f</m> is
    <md>
      <mrow>P_2(x,y) = f(a,b) \amp + f_x(a,b)(x-a) + f_y(a,b)(y-b) + \frac{f_{xx}(a,b)}{2}(x-a)^2</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp + f_{xy}(a,b)(x-a)(y-b) + \frac{f_{yy}(a,b)}{2}(y-b)^2</mrow>
    </md>.
  </p>
  <activity>
    <p>
      To see that <m>P_2(x,y)</m> is the best approximation for <m>f</m> near <m>(a,b)</m>,
      we need to know that the first and second order partial derivatives of <m>P_2</m> agree with the corresponding partial derivatives of <m>f</m> at the point <m>(a,b)</m>.
      Verify that this is true.
    </p>
  </activity>
  <p>
    We can rewrite this second order Taylor polynomial using matrices and vectors so that we can apply techniques from linear algebra to analyze it.
    Note that
    <md>
      <mrow>P_2(x,y) \amp = f(a,b) + \nabla f(a,b)^{\tr} \left[ \begin{array}{c} x-a</mrow>
      <mrow>y-b \end{array} \right]</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp \qquad + \frac{1}{2}\left[ \begin{array}{c} x-a</mrow>
      <mrow>y-b \end{array} \right]^{\tr} \left[ \begin{array}{cc} f_{xx}(a,b)\amp f_{xy}(a,b)</mrow>
      <mrow>f_{xy}(a,b)\amp  f_{yy}(a,b) \end{array} \right] \left[ \begin{array}{c} x-a</mrow>
      <mrow xml:id="eq_Taylor_2_vector" number="yes">y-b \end{array} \right]</mrow>
    </md>,
    where <m>\nabla f(x,y) = \left[ \begin{array}{c} f_x(x,y)\\f_y(x,y) \end{array}  \right]</m> is the gradient of <m>f</m> and <m>H</m> is the
    <em>Hessian</em> of <m>f</m>,
    where <m>H(x,y) = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} f_{xx}(x,y)\amp f_{xy}(x,y) \\ f_{yx}(x,y)\amp  f_{yy}(x,y) \end{array}  \right]</m>.<fn>
    Note that under reasonable conditions (e.g., that <m>f</m> has continuous second order mixed partial derivatives in some open neighborhood containing <m>(x,y)</m>) we have that <m>f_{xy}(x,y) = f_{yx}(x,y)</m> and
    <m>H(x,y) = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} f_{xx}(a,b)\amp f_{xy}(a,b) \\ f_{xy}(a,b)\amp  f_{yy}(a,b) \end{array}  \right]</m> is a symmetric matrix.
    We will only consider functions that satisfy these reasonable conditions.
    </fn>
  </p>
  <activity xml:id="ex_example_1">
    <p>
      Use Equation <xref ref="eq_Taylor_2_vector"/> to compute <m>P_2(x,y)</m> for
      <m>f(x,y)=x^4+y^4-4xy+1</m> at <m>(a, b)=(2,3)</m>.

  <p>
    The important idea for us is that if <m>(a, b)</m> is a point at which <m>f_x</m> and <m>f_y</m> are zero,
    then <m>\nabla f</m> is the zero vector and Equation <xref ref="eq_Taylor_2_vector"/> reduces to
    <men xml:id="eq_Taylor_2_vector_2">
      P_2(x,y) = f(a,b) +  \frac{1}{2}\left[ \begin{array}{c} x-a\\y-b \end{array}  \right]^{\tr} \left[ \begin{array}{cc} f_{xx}(a,b)\amp f_{xy}(a,b) \\ f_{xy}(a,b)\amp  f_{yy}(a,b) \end{array}  \right] \left[ \begin{array}{c} x-a\\y-b \end{array}  \right]

  <p>
    To make the connection between the multivariable second derivative test and properties of the Hessian,
    <m>H(a,b)</m>,
    at a critical point of a function <m>f</m> at which <m>\nabla f = \vzero</m>,
    we will need to connect the eigenvalues of a matrix to the determinant and the trace.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let <m>A</m> be an <m>n \times n</m> matrix with eigenvalues <m>\lambda_1</m>,
    <m>\lambda_2</m>,
    <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\lambda_n</m>
    (not necessarily distinct).
    <xref ref="ex_determinant_eigenvalues">Exercise</xref>
    in <xref ref="sec_characteristic_equation">Section</xref> shows that
    <men xml:id="eq_evals_det">
      \det(A) = \lambda_1 \lambda_2 \cdots \lambda_n
    </men>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In other words,
    the determinant of a matrix is equal to the product of the eigenvalues of the matrix.
    In addition, <xref ref="ex_trace_eigenvalues">Exercise</xref>
    in <xref ref="sec_diagonalization">Section</xref> shows that
    <men xml:id="eq_evals_trace">
      \trace(A) = \lambda_1 +  \lambda_2 + \cdots + \lambda_n
    </men>.
    for a diagonalizable matrix,
    where <m>\trace(A)</m> is the sum of the diagonal entries of <m>A</m>.
    Equation <xref ref="eq_evals_trace"/> is true for any square matrix,
    but we don't need the more general result for this project.
  </p>
  <p>
    The fact that the Hessian is a symmetric matrix makes it orthogonally diagonalizable.
    We denote the eigenvalues of <m>H(a,b)</m> as
    <m>\lambda_1</m> and <m>\lambda_2</m>.
    Thus there exists an orthogonal matrix <m>P</m> and a diagonal matrix
    <m>D = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} \lambda_1\amp 0 \\ 0\amp \lambda_2 \end{array}  \right]</m> such that <m>P^{\tr}H(a,b)P=D</m>,
    or <m>H(a,b) = PDP^{\tr}</m>.
    <xref ref="eq_evals_det">Equations</xref>
    and <xref ref="eq_evals_trace"></xref> show that
    <me>
      \lambda_1\lambda_2 = f_{xx}(a,b)f_{yy}(a,b)-f_{xy}(a,b)^2 \ \text{ and  }  \ \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 = f_{xx}(a,b) + f_{yy}(a,b)
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now we have the machinery to verify the Second Derivative Test for Two-Variable Functions.
    We assume <m>(a,b)</m> is a point in the domain of a function <m>f</m> so that <m>\nabla f(a,b) = \vzero</m>.
    First we consider the case where <m>f_{xx}(a,b)f_{yy}(a,b)-f_{xy}(a,b)^2\lt 0</m>.
  </p>
  <activity>
    <p>
      Explain why if <m>f_{xx}(a,b)f_{yy}(a,b)-f_{xy}(a,b)^2\lt 0</m>, then
      <me>
        \left[ \begin{array}{c} x-a \\ y-b \end{array}  \right]^{\tr} H(a,b) \left[ \begin{array}{c} x-a \\ y-b \end{array}  \right]
      </me>
      is indefinite.
      Explain why this implies that <m>f</m> is
      <q>saddle-shaped</q>
      near <m>(a,b)</m>.
    </p>
    <hint>
      <p>
        Substitute <m>\vw = \left[ \begin{array}{c} w_1\\w_2 \end{array} \right] = P^{\tr}\left[ \begin{array}{c} x-a \\ y-b \end{array} \right]</m>.
        What does the graph of <m>f</m> look like in the <m>w_1</m> and <m>w_2</m> directions?
      </p>
    </hint>
  </activity>
  <p>
    Now we examine the situation when <m>f_{xx}(a,b)f_{yy}(a,b)-f_{xy}(a,b)^2>0</m>.
  </p>
  <activity>
    <p>
      Assume that <m>f_{xx}(a,b)f_{yy}(a,b)-f_{xy}(a,b)^2>0</m>.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Explain why either both <m>f_{xx}(a,b)</m> and
            <m>f_{yy}(a,b)</m> are positive or both are negative.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If <m>f_{xx}(a,b)>0</m> and <m>f_{yy}(a,b)>0</m>,
            explain why <m>\lambda_1</m> and <m>\lambda_2</m> must be positive.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Explain why, if <m>f_{xx}(a,b)>0</m> and <m>f_{yy}(a,b)>0</m>,
            then <m>f(a,b)</m> is a local minimum value for <m>f</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </activity>
  <p>
    When <m>f_{xx}(a,b)f_{yy}(a,b)-f_{xy}(a,b)^2>0</m> and either
    <m>f_{xx}(a,b)</m> or <m>f_{yy}(a,b)</m> is negative,
    a slight modification of the preceding argument leads to the fact that <m>f</m> has a local maximum at <m>(a,b)</m>
    (the details are left to the reader).
    Therefore, we have proved the Second Derivative Test for functions of two variables!
  </p>
  <activity>
    <p>
      Use the Hessian to classify the local maxima,
      minima, and saddle points of <m>f(x,y)=x^4+y^4-4xy+1</m>.
      Draw a graph of <m>f</m> to illustrate.
