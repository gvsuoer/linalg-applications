  <title>Application: The Tennis Racket Effect</title>
  <p>
    Try an experiment with a tennis racket
    (or a squash racket, or a ping pong paddle).
    Let us define a 3D coordinate system with the center of the racket as the origin with the head of the racket lying in the <m>xy</m>-plane.
    We let <m>\vu_1</m> be the vector in the direction of the handle and <m>\vu_2</m> the perpendicular direction
    (still lying in the plane defined by the head)
    as illustrated in <xref ref="F_tennis_racket"></xref>.
    We then let <m>\vu_3</m> be a vector perpendicular to the plane of the head.
    Hold the racket by the handle and spin it to make one rotation around the <m>\vu_1</m> axis.
    This is pretty easy.
    It is also not difficult to throw the racket so that it rotates around the <m>\vu_3</m>.
    Now toss the racket into the air to make one complete rotation around the axis of the vector <m>\vu_2</m> and catch the handle.
    Repeat this several times.
    You should notice that in most instances,
    the racket will also have made a half rotation around the <m>\vu_1</m> axis so that the other face of the racket now points up.
    This is quite different than the rotations around the <m>\vu_1</m> and <m>\vu_3</m> axes.
    A good video that illustrates this behavior can be seen at \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dqCQqI-Gis}.

    This effect is a result in classical mechanics that describes the rotational movement of a rigid body in space,
    called the <em>tennis racket effect</em>
    (or the Dzhanibekov effect,
    after the Russian cosmonaut Vladimir Dzhanibekov who discovered the theorem's consequences while in zero gravity in space <mdash/> you can see an illustration of this in the video at \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2o9eBl_Gzw}).
    The result is simple to see in practice,
    but is difficult to intuitively understand why the behavior is different around the intermediate axis.
    There is a story of a student who asked the famous physicist Richard Feynman if there is any intuitive way to understand the result; Feynman supposedly went into deep thought for about 10 or 15 seconds and answered,
    <q>no.</q>
    As we will see later in this section,
    we can understand this effect using the principal axes of a rigid body.
