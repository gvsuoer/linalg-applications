  <title>Cofactor Expansions</title>
  <p>
    We have stated that the determinant of a matrix can be calculated by using a cofactor expansion along any row or column.
    We use the result that swapping rows introduces a factor of <m>-1</m> in the determinant to verify that result in this section.
    Note that in proving that <m>\det(A^{\tr}) = \det(A)</m>,
    we have already shown that the cofactor expansion along the first column is the same as the cofactor expansion along the first row.
    If we can prove that the cofactor expansion along any row is the same,
    then the fact that <m>\det(A^{\tr}) = \det(A)</m> will imply that the cofactor expansion along any column is the same as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now we demonstrate that the cofactor expansions along the first row and the <m>i</m>th row are the same.
    Let <m>A = [a_{ij}]</m> be an <m>n \times n</m> matrix.
    The cofactor expansion of <m>A</m> along the first row is
    <me>
      a_{11}C_{11} + a_{12}C_{12} + \cdots + a_{1n}C_{1n}
    </me>
    and the cofactor expansion along the <m>i</m>th row is
    <me>
      a_{i1}C_{i1} + a_{i2}C_{i2} + \cdots + a_{in}C_{in}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let <m>B</m> be the matrix obtained by swapping row <m>i</m> with previous rows so that row <m>i</m> becomes the first row and the order of the remaining rows is preserved.
    <!-- Shading for arrays: use \cellcolor[gray]{.9} after the \amp of each cell you want shaded. -->
    <!-- Note: \rowcolor and \columncolor will likely not work well in LaTeX/PDF so stick with more -->
    <!-- labor-intensive \cellcolor -->
    <me>
      B = \left[ \begin{array}{cccccc} \cellcolor[gray]{.9} a_{i1}    \amp \cellcolor[gray]{.9} a_{i2}   \amp \cellcolor[gray]{.9} \cdots  \amp \cellcolor[gray]{.9} a_{ij}   \amp \cellcolor[gray]{.9} \cdots \amp \cellcolor[gray]{.9} a_{in} \\ \cellcolor[gray]{.9} a_{11}     \amp  a_{12}   \amp  \cdots    \amp a_{1j}   \amp \cdots \amp  a_{1n} \\ \cellcolor[gray]{.9} a_{21}     \amp  a_{22}   \amp  \cdots    \amp a_{2j}   \amp \cdots \amp  a_{2n} \\ \cellcolor[gray]{.9} a_{i-11}   \amp  a_{i-12}   \amp  \cdots    \amp a_{i-1j}   \amp \cdots \amp  a_{i-1n} \\ \cellcolor[gray]{.9} a_{i+11}   \amp  a_{i+12}   \amp  \cdots    \amp a_{i+1j}   \amp \cdots \amp  a_{i+1n} \\ \cellcolor[gray]{.9} \vdots     \amp  \ddots    \amp  \vdots     \amp \ddots    \amp       \amp  \\ \cellcolor[gray]{.9} a_{n1}     \amp  a_{n2}   \amp  \cdots    \amp a_{nj}    \amp \cdots \amp  a_{nn} \end{array}  \right]
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Then
    <me>
      \det(B) = (-1)^{i-1} \det(A)
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, letting <m>C'_{ij}</m> be the <m>(i,j)</m> cofactor of <m>B</m> we have
    <me>
      \det(A) = (-1)^{i-1} \det(B) = (-1)^{i-1}\left(a_{i1}C'_{11} + a_{i2}C'_{12} + \cdots + a_{in}C'_{1n}\right)
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Notice that for each <m>j</m> we have <m>B_{1j} = A_{ij}</m>.
    So
    <md>
      <mrow>\det(A) \amp = (-1)^{i-1}\big(a_{i1}C'_{11} + a_{i2}C'_{12} + \cdots + a_{in}C'_{1n}\big)</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp = (-1)^{i-1}\Big(a_{i1}(-1)^(1+1)\det(B_{11}) + a_{i2}(-1)^{1+2}\det(B_{12})</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp \qquad + \cdots + a_{in}(-1)^{1+n}\det(B_{1n})\Big)</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp = (-1)^{i-1}\Big(a_{i1}(-1)^(1+1)\det(A_{i1}) + a_{i2}(-1)^{1+2}\det(A_{i2})</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp \qquad + \cdots + a_{in}(-1)^{1+n}\det(A_{in})\Big)</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp = a_{i1}(-1)^(i+1)\det(A_{i1}) + a_{i2}(-1)^{i+2}\det(A_{i2})</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp \qquad + \cdots + a_{in}(-1)^{i+n}\det(A_{in})</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp = a_{i1}C_{i1} + a_{i2}C_{i2} + \cdots + a_{in}C_{in}</mrow>
    </md>.
