  <p>
    Sheep farming is a significant industry in New Zealand.
    New Zealand is reported to have the highest density of sheep in the world.
    Sheep can begin to reproduce after one year,
    and give birth only once per year.
    <xref ref="T_Sheep"></xref> gives Birth and Survival Rates for Female New Zealand Sheep (from G. Caughley,
    <articletitle>Parameters for Seasonally Breeding Populations,</articletitle>
    <pubtitle>Ecology</pubtitle>, <em>48</em>, (1967), 834-839).
    Since sheep hardly ever live past 12 years,
    we will only consider the population through 12 years.

    As sheep reproduce, they add to the 0-1 sheep (lamb) population.
    The potential to produce offspring is called <term>fecundity</term>
    (derived from the word <term>fecund</term>
    which generally refers to reproductive ability)
    and determines how many lamb are added to the population.
    Let <m>F_k</m>
    (the fecundity rate)
    be the rate at which females in age class <m>k</m> give birth to female offspring.
    Not all members of a given age group survive to the next age groups,
    so let <m>s_k</m> be the fraction of individuals that survives from age group <m>k</m> to age group <m>k+1</m>.
    With these ideas in mind,
    we can create a life cycle chart as in <xref ref="F_Life_cycle"></xref>
    that illustrates how the population of sheep changes on a farm
    (for the sake of space, we illustrate with four age classes).

    To model the sheep population, we need a few variables.
    Let <m>n_1^{(0)}</m> be the number of sheep in age group 0-1,
    <m>n_2^{(0)}</m> the number in age group 1-2, <m>n_3</m> the number in age group 2-3 and,
    in general,
    <m>n_k^{(0)}</m> the number of sheep in age group <m>(k-1)</m>-<m>k</m> at some initial time
    (time <m>0</m>),
    and let
    <me>
      \vx_0 = \left[ n_1^{(0)} \ n_2^{(0)} \ n_3^{(0)} \ \cdots \ n_{12}^{(0)} \right]^{\tr}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We wish to determine the populations in the different groups after one year.
    Let
    <me>
      \vx_1 = \left[ n_1^{(1)} \ n_2^{(1)} \ n_3^{(1)}  \ \cdots \ n_{12}^{(1)} \right]^{\tr}
    </me>,
    where <m>n_1^{(1)}</m> denotes the number of sheep in age group 0-1,
    <m>n_2^{(1)}</m> the number of sheep in age group 1-2 and,

  <p>
    Leslie matrices have certain useful properties,
    and one eigenvalue of a Leslie matrix can tell us a lot about the long-term behavior of the situation being modeled.
    You can take these properties as fact unless otherwise directed.
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          A Leslie matrix <m>L</m> has a unique positive eigenvalue
          <m>\lambda_1</m> with a corresponding eigenvector <m>\vv_1</m> whose entries are all positive.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If <m>\lambda_i</m> (<m>i > 1</m>) is any other eigenvalue
          (real or complex)
          of <m>L</m>, then <m>|\lambda_i| \leq \lambda_1</m>.
          If <m>\lambda_1</m> is the largest magnitude eigenvalue of a matrix <m>L</m>,
          we call <m>\lambda_1</m> a <term>dominant eigenvalue</term> of <m>L</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If any two successive entries in the first row of <m>L</m> are both positive,
          then <m>|\lambda_i| \lt \lambda_1</m> for every <m>i > 1</m>.
          In this case we say that <m>\lambda_1</m> is a
          <term>strictly dominant eigenvalue</term> of <m>L</m>.
          In a Leslie model,
          this happens when the females in two successive age classes are fertile,
          which is almost always the case.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If <m>\lambda_1</m> is a strictly dominant eigenvalue,
          then <m>\vx_k</m> is approximately a scalar multiple of <m>\vv_1</m> for large values of <m>k</m>,
          regardless of the initial state <m>\vx_0</m>.
          In other words,
          large state vectors are close to eigenvectors for <m>\lambda_1</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    We can use these properties to determine the long-term behavior of the sheep herd.

            We can use the third and fourth properties of Leslie matrices to better understand the long-term behavior of the sheep population.
            Since successive entries in the first row of the Leslie matrix in <xref ref="eq_Leslie_2"/> are positive,
            our Leslie matrix has a strictly dominant eigenvalue <m>\lambda_1</m>.
            Given the dimensions of our Leslie matrix,
            finding this dominant eigenvalue through algebraic means is not feasible.
            Use the power method to approximate the dominant eigenvalue
            <m>\lambda_1</m> of the Leslie matrix in <xref ref="eq_Leslie_2"/> to five decimal places.
            Explain your process.
            Then explain how this dominant eigenvalue tells us that,
            unchecked,
            the sheep population grows at a rate that is roughly exponential.
            What is the growth rate of this exponential growth?

  <p>
    <xref ref="act_Leslie_2"></xref> indicates that,
    unchecked, the sheep population will grow without bound,
    roughly exponentially with ratio equal to the dominant eigenvalue of our Leslie matrix <m>L</m>.
    Of course, a sheep farmer cannot provide the physical environment or the resources to support an unlimited population of sheep.
    In addition,
    most sheep farmers cannot support themselves only by shearing sheep for the wool.
    Consequently,
    some harvesting of the sheep population each year for meat and skin is necessary.
    A sustainable harvesting policy allows for the regular harvesting of some sheep while maintaining the population at a stable level.
    It is necessary for the farmer to find an optimal harvesting rate to attain this stable population and the following activity leads us through an analysis of how such a harvesting rate can be determined.

    <introduction>
    <p>
      The Leslie model can be modified to consider harvesting.
      It is possible to harvest different age groups at different rates,
      and to harvest only some age groups and not others.
      In the case of sheep,
      it might make sense to only harvest from the youngest population since lamb is more desirable than mutton and the lamb population grows the fastest.
      Assume that this is our harvesting strategy and that we harvest our sheep from only the youngest age group at the start of each year.
      Let <m>h</m> be the fraction of sheep we harvest from the youngest age group each year after considering growth.

            Our goal is to find a harvesting rate that will lead to a steady state in which the sheep population remains the same each year.
            In other words, we want to find a value of <m>h</m>,
            if one exists, that satisfies
            <men xml:id="eq_Harvest">
              \vx = L\vx - HL\vx
            </men>.
            Show that <xref ref="eq_Harvest"/> is equivalent to the matrix equation
            <men xml:id="eq_Harvest2">
              \vx = (I_{12}-H)L\vx

            Use appropriate technology to experiment numerically with different values of <m>h</m> to find the value you think gives the best uniform harvest rate.

            Now we will use some algebra to find an equation that explicitly gives us the harvest rate in the general setting.
            This will take a bit of work,
            but none of it is too difficult.
            To simplify our work but yet illustrate the overall idea,
            let us consider the general
            <m>4 \times 4</m> case with arbitrary Leslie matrix
            <me>
              L = \left[ \begin{array}{cccc} F_1 \amp  F_2   \amp  F_3   \amp  F_4 \\ s_1 \amp  0   \amp  0   \amp  0  \\ 0   \amp  s_2   \amp  0   \amp  0 \\ 0   \amp  0   \amp  s_3  \amp  0 \end{array}  \right]
            </me>.
            Recall that we want to find a value of <m>h</m> that satisfies <xref ref="eq_Harvest2"/> with <m>H = \left[ \begin{array}{cccc} h   \amp  0   \amp  0   \amp  0 \\ 0   \amp  0   \amp  0   \amp  0  \\ 0   \amp  0   \amp  0   \amp  0 \\ 0   \amp  0   \amp  0      \amp  0 \end{array}  \right]</m>.
            Let <m>\vx = [x_1 \  x_2 \ x_3 \ x_4]^{\tr}</m>.

                  Calculate the matrix product <m>(I_{4}-H)L</m>.
                  Explain why this product is again a Leslie matrix and why
                  <m>(I_{4}-H)L</m> will have a dominant eigenvalue of 1.

                  Now calculate <m>(I_{4}-H)L\vx</m> and set it equal to <m>\vx</m>.
                  Write down the resulting system of 4 equations that must be satisfied.
                  Be sure that your first equation is
                  <men xml:id="eq_harvestval1">
                    x_1 = (1-h)F_1x_1 + (1-h)F_2x_2 + (1-h)F_3x_3 + (1-h)F_4x_4
                  </men>.

                  Equation <xref ref="eq_harvestval1"/> as written depends on the entries of the vector <m>\vx</m>,
                  but we should be able to arrive at a result that is independent of <m>\vx</m>.
                  To see how we do this,
                  we assume the population of the youngest group is never 0, so we can divide both sides of <xref ref="eq_harvestval1"/> by <m>x_1</m> to obtain
                  <men xml:id="eq_harvestval2">
                    1 = (1-h)F_1 + (1-h)F_2 \frac{x_2}{x_1} + (1-h)F_3 \frac{x_3}{x_1} + (1-h)F_4 \frac{x_4}{x_1}
                  </men>.
                  Now we need to write the fractions
                  <m>\frac{x_2}{x_1}</m>,   <m>\frac{x_3}{x_1}</m>,
                  and <m>\frac{x_4}{x_1}</m> so that they do not involve the <m>x_i</m>.
                  Use the remaining equations in your system to show that
                  <md>
                    <mrow>\frac{x_2}{x_1} \amp = s_1</mrow>
                    <mrow>\frac{x_3}{x_1} \amp = s_1s_2</mrow>
                    <mrow>\frac{x_4}{x_1} \amp = s_1s_2s_3</mrow>

                  Now conclude that the harvesting value <m>h</m> must satisfy the equation
                  <men xml:id="eq_harvestval3">
                    1 = (1-h) [F_1 + F_2 s_1 + F_3 s_1s_2 + F_4 s_1s_2s_3]
                  </men>.
                  The value <m>R = F_1 + F_2 s_1 + F_3 s_1s_2 + F_4 s_1s_2s_3</m> is called the
                  <term>net reproduction rate of the population</term>
                  and turns out to be the average number of daughters born to a female in her expected lifetime.

            Compare this <m>h</m> to the value you obtained through experimentation earlier.
            Find the fraction of the lambs that should be harvested each year and explain what the stable population state vector <m>\vx</m> tells us about the sheep population for this harvesting policy.
