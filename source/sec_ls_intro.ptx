      NBC was awarded the U.S. television broadcast rights to the 2016 and 2020 summer Olympic games.
      <xref ref="T_LS_Olympics">Table</xref> lists the amounts paid
      (in millions of dollars)
      by NBC sports for the 2008 through 2012 summer Olympics plus the recently concluded bidding for the 2016 and 2020 Olympics,
      where year 0 is the year 2008. (We will assume a simple model here,
      ignoring variations such as value of money due to inflation,
      viewership data which might affect NBC's expected revenue,
      etc.) <xref ref="F_LS_Olympics"></xref> shows a plot of the data.
      Our goal in this activity is to find a linear function <m>f</m> defined by
      <m>f(x) = a_0 + a_1x</m> that fits the data well.

      If the data were actually linear,
      then the data would satisfy the system
      <md>
        <mrow> {}a_0 \amp {}+{}  \amp {0}a_1 \amp = \amp 894\amp {}</mrow>
        <mrow>{}a_0 \amp {}+{}  \amp {4}a_1 \amp = \amp 1180\amp {}</mrow>
        <mrow>{}a_0 \amp {}+{}  \amp {8}a_1 \amp = \amp 1226\amp {}</mrow>
        <mrow>{}a_0 \amp {}+{}  \amp {12}a_1 \amp = \amp 1418\amp {.}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      The vector form of this equation is
      <me>
        a_0 [1 \ 1 \ 1 \ 1]^{\tr} + a_1[0 \ 4 \ 8 \ 12]^{\tr} = [894 \ 1180 \ 1226 \ 1418]^{\tr}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This equation does not have a solution,
      so we seek the best approximation to a solution we can find.
      That is, we want to find <m>a_0</m> and <m>a_1</m> so that the line
      <m>f(x) = a_0+a_1x</m> provides a best fit to the data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Letting <m>\vv_1 = [1 \ 1 \ 1 \ 1]^{\tr}</m> and <m>\vv_2 = [0 \ 4 \ 8 \ 12]^{\tr}</m>,
      and <m>\vb = [894 \ 1180 \ 1226 \ 1418]^{\tr}</m>,
      our vector equation becomes
      <me>
        a_0 \vv_1 + a_1\vv_2 = \vb
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make a best fit,
      we will minimize the square of the distance between <m>\vb</m> and a vector of the form <m>a_0\vv_1 + a_1 \vv_2</m>.
      That is, minimize
      <men xml:id="eq_LS_line_1">
        ||\vb - (a_0 \vv_1 + a_1\vv_2)||^2
      </men>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rephrasing this in terms of projections,
      we are looking for the vector in
      <m>W = \Span\{\vv_1, \vv_2\}</m> that is closest to <m>\vb</m>.
      In other words,
      the values of <m>a_0</m> and <m>a_1</m> will occur as the weights when we write
      <m>\proj_{W} \vb</m> as a linear combination of <m>\vv_1</m> and <m>\vv_2</m>.
      The one wrinkle in this problem is that we need an orthogonal basis for <m>W</m> to find this projection.
      Use appropriate technology throughout this activity.

        <li>
          <p>
            Find an orthogonal basis <m>\CB = \{\vw_1, \vw_2\}</m> for <m>W</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Use the basis <m>\CB</m> to find
            <m>\vy = \proj_{W} \vb</m> as illustrated in <xref ref="F_6_f_proj"></xref>.

            Draw a picture of your line from the previous part on the axes with the data set.
            How well do you think your line approximates the data?
            Explain.
