  <title>The Matrix-Vector Product</title>
  <p>
    The matrix-vector product we defined in <xref ref="pa_1_e"></xref>
    for a specific example generalizes in a very straightforward manner,
    and provides a convenient way to represent a system of linear equations of any size using matrices and vectors.
    In addition to providing us with an algebraic approach to solving systems via matrices and vectors <mdash/> leading to a powerful geometric relationship between solution sets of homogeneous and non-homogeneous systems <mdash/> this representation allows us to think of a linear system from a dynamic perspective,
    as we will see later in the section on matrix transformations.
  </p>
  <p>
    The matrix-vector product <m>A \vx</m> is a linear combination of the columns of <m>A</m> with weights from <m>\vx</m>.
    To define this product in general,
    we will need a little notation.
    Recall that a matrix is made of rows and columns <mdash/> the entries reading from left to right form the <em>rows</em>
        <idx><h>matrix</h><h>rows</h></idx>
    of the matrix and the entries reading from top to bottom form the <em>columns</em>.
        <idx><h>matrix</h><h>columns</h></idx>
    For example, the matrix
    <me>
      A = \left[ \begin{array}{cccc} 1 \amp  2 \amp  3 \amp  4 \\ 5 \amp  6 \amp  7 \amp  8  \\ 9 \amp  10 \amp  11 \amp  12 \end{array}  \right]
    </me>.
    has three rows and four columns.
    The number of rows and columns of a matrix is called the <em>size</em>
        <idx><h>matrix</h><h>size</h></idx>
    of the matrix, so <m>A</m> is a 3 by 4 matrix
    (also written as <m>3 \times 4</m>).
    We often need to have a way to reference the individual entries of a matrix <m>A</m>,
    and to do so we typically give a label,
    say <m>a_{ij}</m> to the entry in the <m>i</m>th row and <m>j</m>th column of <m>A</m>.
    So in our example we have <m>a_{23}=7</m>.
    We also write <m>A = [a_{ij}]</m> to indicate a matrix whose <m>i,j</m>th entry is <m>a_{ij}</m>.
    At times it is convenient to write a matrix in terms of its rows or columns.
    If <m>A = [a_{ij}]</m> is an
    <m>m \times n</m> matrix, then we will write
    <me>
      A = \left[ \begin{array}{ccccc} a_{11} \amp  a_{12}  \amp  \cdots    \amp  a_{1n-1} \amp  a_{1n} \\ a_{21} \amp  a_{22}  \amp  \cdots    \amp  a_{2n-1} \amp  a_{2n} \\ \vdots \amp          \amp  \ddots    \amp      \amp \vdots \\ a_{m1} \amp  a_{m2}  \amp  \cdots    \amp  a_{mn-1} \amp  a_{mn} \end{array}  \right]
    </me>
    or, if we let <m>\vr_1, \vr_2, \ldots, \vr_m</m> denote the rows of the matrix <m>A</m>,
    then we can write <m>A</m> as<fn>
    Technically,
    the rows of <m>A</m> are made from the entries of the row vectors,
    but we use this notation as a shorthand.
    </fn>
    <me>
      A = \left[ \begin{array}{c} \vr_1 \\ \vr_2 \\ \vdots \\ \vr_m \end{array}  \right]
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can also write <m>A</m> in terms of its columns,
    <m>\vc_1, \vc_2, \ldots, \vc_n</m>, as
    <me>
      A = [\vc_1 \ \vc_2 \ \cdots \ \vc_n]
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In general, the product of a matrix with a vector is defined as follows.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be an <m>m \times n</m> matrix with columns <m>\vc_1</m>,
        <m>\vc_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\vc_n</m>,
        and let <m>\vx = \left[ \begin{array}{c} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \vdots \\ x_n \end{array}  \right]</m> be a vector in <m>\R^n</m>.
        The <term>matrix-vector product</term>
            <idx><h>matrix-vector product</h></idx>
        <m>A\vx</m> is
        <me>
          A \vx = x_1 \vc_1 + x_2 \vc_2 + \cdots + x_n \vc_n
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    <em>Important Note:</em> The matrix-vector product <m>A \vx</m> is defined only when the number of entries of the vector <m>\vx</m> is equal to the number of columns of the matrix <m>A</m>.
    That is, if <m>A</m> is an <m>m \times n</m> matrix,
    then <m>A\vx</m> is defined only if <m>\vx</m> is a column vector with <m>n</m> entries.
