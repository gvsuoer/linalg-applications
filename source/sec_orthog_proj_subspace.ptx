  <title>Orthogonal Projections onto Subspaces</title>
  <p>
    In <xref ref="sec_gram_schmidt">Section</xref>
    we saw how to project a vector <m>\vv</m> in <m>\R^n</m> onto a subspace <m>W</m> of <m>\R^n</m>.
    The same process works for vectors in any inner product space.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>W</m> be a subspace of an inner product space <m>V</m> and let
        <m>\CB = \{\vw_1, \vw_2, \ldots, \vw_m\}</m> be an orthogonal basis for <m>W</m>.
        For a vector <m>\vv</m> in <m>V</m>,
        the <term>orthogonal projection of <m>\vv</m> onto <m>W</m></term><idx><h>orthogonal projection onto a subspace</h></idx> is the vector
        <me>
          \proj_W \vv =  \frac{\langle \vv, \vw_1 \rangle }{\langle \vw_1, \vw_1 \rangle } \vw_1 + \frac{\langle \vv, \vw_2 \rangle }{\langle \vw_2, \vw_2 \rangle }  \vw_2 + \cdots + \frac{\langle \vv, \vw_m \rangle}{\langle \vw_m, \vw_m \rangle} \vw_m
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <term>projection of <m>\vv</m> orthogonal to <m>W</m></term><idx><h>projection orthogonal to a subspace</h></idx> is the vector
        <me>
          \proj_{W^{\perp}} \vv = \vv - \proj_W \vv
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    The notation <m>\proj_{W^{\perp}} \vv</m> indicates that we expect this vector to be orthogonal to every vector in <m>W</m>.

      In <xref ref="sec_gram_schmidt">Section</xref>
      we showed that in the inner product space <m>\R^n</m> using the dot product as inner product,
      if <m>W</m> is a subspace of <m>\R^n</m> and <m>\vv</m> is in <m>\R^n</m>,
      then <m>\proj_{W^{\perp}} \vv</m> is orthogonal to every vector in <m>W</m>.
      In this activity we verify that same fact in an inner product space.
      That is, assume that <m>\CB = \{\vw_1, \vw_2, \ldots, \vw_m\}</m> is an orthogonal basis for a subspace <m>W</m> of an inner product space <m>V</m> and <m>\vv</m> is a vector in <m>V</m>.
      Follow the indicated steps to show that
      <m>\proj_{W^{\perp}} \vv</m> is orthogonal to every vector in <m>\CB</m>.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Let <m>\vz</m> be the projection of <m>\vv</m> onto <m>W</m>.
            Write <m>\vz</m> in terms of the basis vectors in <m>\CB</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The vector <m>\vv - \vz</m> is the projection of <m>\vv</m> orthogonal to <m>W</m>.
            Let <m>k</m> be between <m>1</m> and <m>m</m>.
            Use the result of part (a) to show that
            <m>\vv - \vz</m> is orthogonal to <m>\vw_k</m>.
            <xref ref="ex_6_c_orth_complement_basis">Exercise</xref>
            then shows that <m>\vv - \vz</m> is orthogonal to every vector in <m>W</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </activity>
  <p>
    <xref ref="act_6_c_orth_projection">Activity</xref>
    shows that the vector <m>\vv - \vw</m> is orthogonal to vector for <m>W</m>.
    So, in fact,
    <m>\proj_{W^\perp} \vv</m> is the projection of <m>\vv</m> onto the orthogonal complement of <m>W</m>,
    which will be defined shortly.
