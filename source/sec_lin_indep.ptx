  <title>Linear Independence</title>
  <p>
    The concept of linear independence,
    which we formally defined in <xref ref="pa_5_b"></xref>,
    provides us with a process to determine if there is redundancy in a spanning set to 
    obtain an efficient spanning set.
  </p>
  <p>
    The definition tells us that a set
    <m>\{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_k\}</m> of vectors in a vector space <m>V</m> is linearly 
    dependent if there are scalars <m>x_1</m>,
    <m>x_2</m>,
    <m>\ldots</m>, <m>x_n</m>, not all of which are 0 so that
    <me>
      x_1 \vv_1 + x_2 \vv_2 + \cdots + x_k \vv_k = \vzero
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    As examples,
    we saw in <xref ref="pa_5_b"></xref>
    that the set <m>\{1+t, 1-t\}</m> is linearly independent in <m>\pol_1</m>.
    The set <m>\{1+t, -1+2t+t^2, 1-8t-3t^2\}</m>, on the other hand,
    is linearly dependent in <m>\pol_2</m> since <m>2(1+t) + 3(-1+2t+t^2) + (1-8t-3t^2) = 0</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to the definition,
    there are other ways to characterize linearly independent and dependent sets in vector 
    spaces as the next theorems illustrate.
    These characterizations are the same as those we saw in <m>\R^n</m>,
    and the proofs are essentially the same as well.
    The proof of <xref ref="thm_5_b_1"></xref>
    is similar to that of <xref ref="thm_dependence"></xref>
    and is left for the exercises.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm_5_b_1">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A set <m>\{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_k\}</m> of vectors in a vector space <m>V</m> is linearly dependent if and only if at least one of the vectors in the set can be written as a linear combination of the remaining vectors in the set.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    <xref ref="thm_5_b_1"></xref>
    is equivalent to the following theorem that provides the corresponding result for linearly independent sets.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm_5_b_2">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A set <m>\{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_k\}</m> of vectors in a vector space <m>V</m> is linearly independent if and only if no vector in the set can be written as a linear combination of the remaining vectors in the set.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    One consequence of <xref ref="thm_5_b_1"></xref>
    and <xref ref="thm_5_b_2"></xref>
    is that if a spanning set is linearly dependent,
    then one of the vectors in the set can be written as a linear combination of the others.
    In other words, at least one of the vectors is redundant.
    In that case,
    we can find a smaller spanning set as the next theorem states.
    The proof of this theorem is similar to that of <xref ref="thm_minimal_spanning_set"></xref>
    and is left for the exercises.
  </p>
  
  <theorem xml:id="thm_5_b_3">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_k\}</m> be a set of vectors in a vector space <m>V</m>.
        If for some <m>i</m> between 1 and <m>k</m>,
        <m>\vv_i</m> is in <m>\Span \{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_{i-1}, \vv_{i+1}, \ldots, \vv_k\}</m>, then
        <me>
          \Span\{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_k\} = \Span\{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_{i-1}, \vv_{i+1}, \ldots, \vv_k\}
        </me>.
