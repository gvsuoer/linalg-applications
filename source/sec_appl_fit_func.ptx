  <title>Application: Fitting Functions to Data</title>
  <p>
    Data is all around us.
    Data is collected on almost everything and it is important to be able to use data to make predictions.
    However, data is rarely well-behaved and so we generally need to use approximation techniques to estimate from the data.
    One technique for this is least squares approximations.
    As we will see,
    we can use linear algebra to fit a variety of different types of curves to data.
