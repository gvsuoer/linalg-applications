  <title>Project: Binet's Formula for the Fibonacci Numbers</title>
  <p>
    We return to the Fibonacci sequence <m>F_n</m> where <m>F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_{n}</m>,
    for <m>n \geq 0</m>, <m>F_0 = 0</m>, and <m>F_1=1</m>.
    Since <m>F_{n+2}</m> is determined by previous values <m>F_{n+1}</m> and <m>F_n</m>,
    the relation <m>F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_{n}</m> is called a
    <em>recurrence relation</em>.
    The recurrence relation <m>F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_{n}</m> is very time consuming to use to compute <m>F_n</m> for large values of <m>n</m>.
    It turns out that there is a fascinating formula that gives the <m>n</m>th term of the Fibonacci sequence directly,
    without using the relation <m>F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_{n}</m>.
  </p>
  <activity>
    <p>
      The recurrence relation<m>F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_{n}</m> gives the equations
      <md>
        <mrow xml:id="eq_Fib_1" number="yes">F_{n+1} \amp = F_{n} + F_{n-1}</mrow>
        <mrow xml:id="eq_Fib_2" number="yes">F_{n} \amp = F_{n}</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>\vx_{n} = \left[ \begin{array}{c} F_{n+1} \\ F_{n} \end{array}  \right]</m> for <m>n \geq 0</m>.
      Explain how the equations <xref ref="eq_Fib_1"/> and <xref ref="eq_Fib_1"/> can be described with the matrix equation
      <men xml:id="eq_Fib_matrix">
        \vx_n = A \vx_{n-1}
      </men>,
      where <m>A = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 1\amp 1 \\ 1\amp 0 \end{array}  \right]</m>.
    </p>
  </activity>
  <p>
    The matrix equation <xref ref="eq_Fib_matrix"/> shows us how to find the vectors <m>\vx_n</m> using powers of the matrix <m>A</m>:
    <md>
      <mrow>\vx_1 \amp = A\vx_0</mrow>
      <mrow>\vx_2 \amp = A\vx_1 = A(A\vx_0) = A^2\vx_0</mrow>
      <mrow>\vx_3 \amp = A\vx_2 = A(A^2\vx_0) = A^3\vx_0</mrow>
      <mrow>\ \vdots \amp  \qquad \vdots</mrow>
      <mrow>\vx_n \amp = A^n\vx_0</mrow>
    </md>.
  </p>
  <p>
    So if we can somehow easily find the powers of the matrix <m>A</m>,
    then we can find a convenient formula for <m>F_n</m>.
    As we have seen,
    we know how to do this if <m>A</m> is diagonalizable
  </p>
  <activity>
    <p>
      Let <m>A = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 1\amp 1 \\ 1\amp 0 \end{array} \right]</m>.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Show that the eigenvalues of <m>A</m> are
            <m>\gr = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}</m> and <m>\grc = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Find bases for each eigenspace of <m>A</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </activity>
  <p>
    Now that we have the eigenvalues and know corresponding eigenvectors for <m>A</m>,
    we can return to the problem of diagonalizing <m>A</m>.
  </p>
  <activity>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Why do we know that <m>A</m> is diagonalizable?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Find a matrix <m>P</m> such that
          <m>P^{-1}AP</m> is a diagonal matrix.
          What is the diagonal matrix?
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </activity>
  <p>
    Now we can find a formula for the <m>n</m>th Fibonacci number.
  </p>
  <activity>
    <p>
      Since <m>P^{-1}AP = D</m>,
      where <m>D</m> is a diagonal matrix,
      we also have <m>A = PDP^{-1}</m>.
      Recall that when <m>A = PDP^{-1}</m>,
      it follows that <m>A^n = PD^nP^{-1}</m>.
      Use the equation <m>A^n = PD^nP^{-1}</m> to show that
      <men xml:id="eq_Binet">
        F_n = \frac{\gr^n - \grc^n}{\sqrt{5}}
      </men>.
    </p>
    <hint>
      <p>
        We just need to calculate the second component of <m>A^n \vx_0</m>.
      </p>

    Formula <xref ref="eq_Binet"/> is called
    <em>Binet's formula</em>.
        <idx><h>Binet's formula</h></idx>
    It is a very surprising formula in the fact that the expression on the right hand side of <xref ref="eq_Binet"/> is an integer for each positive integer <m>n</m>.
    Note that with Binet's formula we can quickly compute <m>F_n</m> for very large values of <m>n</m>.
    For example,
    <me>
      F_{150} = 9969216677189303386214405760200
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The number <m>\gr = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}</m>,
    called the <em>golden mean</em> or <em>golden ratio</em>
    is intimately related to the Fibonacci sequence.
    Binet's formula provides a fascinating relationship between the Fibonacci numbers and the golden ratio.
    The golden ratio also occurs often in other areas of mathematics.
    It was an important number to the ancient Greek mathematicians who felt that the most aesthetically pleasing rectangles had sides in the ratio of <m>\gr:1</m>.
  </p>
  <activity>
    <p>
      You might wonder what happens if we use negative integer exponents in Binet's formula.
      In other words, are there negatively indexed Fibonacci numbers?
      For any integer <m>n</m>, including negative integers, let
      <me>
        F_n = \frac{\gr^n - \grc^n}{\sqrt{5}}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a specific relationship between <m>F_{-n}</m> and <m>F_n</m>.
      Find it and verify it.
