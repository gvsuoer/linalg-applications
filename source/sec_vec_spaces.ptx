    The set of <m>n</m>-dimensional vectors with the vector addition and scalar multiplication satisfy many properties,
    such as addition being commutative and associative,
    existence of an additive identity, and others.
    The set <m>\R^n</m> with these properties is an example of a <term>vector space</term>,
    a general structure examples of which include many other algebraic structures as we will see later.

    <xref ref="thm_vector_properties"></xref>
    in <xref ref="chap_vector_representation"></xref>
    shows that <m>\R^n</m> is itself a vector space.
    As we will see,
    there are many other sets that have the same algebraic structure.
    By focusing on this structure and the properties of these operations,
    we can extend the theory of vectors we developed so far to a broad range of objects,
    making it easier to work with them.
    For example,
    we can consider linear combinations of functions or matrices,
    or define a basis for different types of sets of objects.
    Such algebraic tools provide us with new ways of looking at these sets of objects,
    including a geometric intuition when working with these sets.
    In this section,
    we will analyze subsets of <m>\R^n</m> which behave similar to <m>\R^n</m> algebraically.
    We will call such sets <term>subspaces</term>.
    In a later chapter we will encounter different kinds of sets that are also vector spaces.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def_3_a_subspaces">
    <idx><h>subspace</h><h>of <m>\R^n</m></h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A subset <m>W</m> of <m>\R^n</m> is a
        <term>subspace</term> of <m>\R^n</m> if <m>W</m> itself is a vector space using the same operations as in <m>\R^n</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    The following example illustrates the process for demonstrating that a subset of <m>\R^n</m> is a subspace of <m>\R^n</m>.
  </p>
  
  <example xml:id="ex_3_a_1">
    <statement>
      <p>
        There are many subsets of <m>\R^n</m> that are themselves vector spaces.
        Consider as an example the set <m>W</m> of vectors in <m>\R^2</m> defined by
        <me>
          W = \left\{ \left[ \begin{array}{c} x \\ 0 \end{array}  \right] \middle| x \text{ is a real number } \right\}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words,
        <m>W</m> is the set of vectors in <m>\R^2</m> whose second component is 0.
        To see that <m>W</m> is itself a vector space,
        we need to demonstrate that <m>W</m> satisfies all of the properties listed in <xref ref="def_3_a_1"></xref>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To prove the first property,
        we need to show that the sum of <em>any</em>
        two vectors in <m>W</m> is again in <m>W</m>.
        So we need to choose two <term>arbitrary</term> vectors in <m>W</m>.
        Let <m>\vu = \left[ \begin{array}{c} x \\ 0 \end{array}  \right]</m> and
        <m>\vv = \left[ \begin{array}{c} y \\ 0 \end{array}  \right]</m> be vectors in <m>W</m>.
        Note that
        <me>
          \vu + \vv = \left[ \begin{array}{c} x \\ 0 \end{array}  \right] + \left[ \begin{array}{c} y \\ 0 \end{array}  \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c} x+y \\ 0 \end{array}  \right]
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the second component of
        <m>\vu + \vv</m> is 0, it follows that <m>\vu + \vv</m> is in <m>W</m>.
        Thus, the set <m>W</m> is closed under addition.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the second property, that addition is commutative in <m>W</m>,
        we can just use the fact that if <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> are in <m>W</m>,
        they are also vectors in <m>\R^2</m> and
        <m>\vu+\vv=\vv+\vu</m> is satisfied in <m>\R^2</m>.
        So the property also holds in <m>W</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A similar argument can be made for property (3).
      </p>
      <p>
        Property (4) states the existence of the additive identity in <m>W</m>.
        Note that <m>\vzero</m> is an additive identity in <m>\R^2</m> and if it is also an element in <m>W</m>,
        then it will automatically be the additive identity of <m>W</m>.
        Since the zero vector can be written as <m>\vzero=\left[ \begin{array}{c} x \\ 0 \end{array} \right]</m> with <m>x=0</m>,
        <m>\vzero</m> is in <m>W</m>.
        Thus, <m>W</m> satisfies property 4.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will postpone property (5) for a bit since we can show that other properties imply property (5).
      </p>
      <p>
        Property (6) is a closure property, just like property (1).
        We need to verify that <em>any</em>
        scalar multiple of <em>any</em>
        vector in <m>W</m> is again in <m>W</m>.
        Consider an arbitrary vector <m>\vu</m> and an arbitrary scalar <m>a</m>.
        Now
        <me>
          a \vu = a\left[ \begin{array}{c} x \\ 0 \end{array}  \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c} ax \\ 0 \end{array}  \right]
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the vector <m>a \vu</m> has a 0 as its second component,
        we see that <m>a \vu</m> is in <m>W</m>.
        Thus, <m>W</m> is closed under scalar multiplication.
      </p>
      <p>
        Properties (7), (8), (9) and (10) only depend on the operations of addition and multiplication by scalars in <m>\R^2</m>.
        Since these properties depend on the operations and not the vectors,
        these properties will transfer to <m>W</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We still have to justify property (5) though.
        Note that since <m>1-1=0</m> in real numbers,
        by applying property (7) with <m>a=1</m>, <m>b=-1</m>,
        we find that
        <me>
          \vzero=0\vu=(a+b)\vu=a\vu+b\vu= \vu + (-1)\vu \,
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, <m>(-1)\vu</m> is an additive inverse for <m>\vu</m>.
        Therefore, to show that the additive inverse of any <m>\vu</m> in <m>W</m> is also in <m>W</m>,
        we simply note that any multiple of <m>\vu</m> is also in <m>W</m> and hence <m>(-1)\vu</m> must also be in <m>W</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>W</m> satisfies all of the properties of a vector space,
        <m>W</m> is a vector space.
        Any subset of <m>\R^n</m> that is itself a vector space using the same operations as in <m>\R^n</m> is called a
        <term>subspace</term> of <m>\R^n</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <p>
    <xref ref="ex_3_a_1"></xref>
    and our work <xref ref="pa_3_a"></xref>
    bring out some important ideas.
    When checking that a subset <m>W</m> of a vector space <m>\R^n</m> is also a vector space,
    we can use the fact that all of the properties of the operations in <m>\R^n</m> are transferred to any closed subset <m>W</m>.
    This implies that properties (2), (3), (7)-(10) are all automatically satisfied for <m>W</m> as well.
    Property (5) follows from the others.
    So we only need to check properties (1), (4) and (6).
    In fact, as we argued in the above example,
    property (4) also needs to be checked by simply checking that <m>\vzero</m> of <m>\R^n</m> is in <m>W</m>.
    We summarize this result in the following theorem.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm_3_a_subspace_Rn">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A subset <m>W</m> of <m>\R^n</m> is a subspace of <m>\R^n</m> if

          <li>
            <p>
              whenever <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> are in <m>W</m> it is also true that
              <m>\vu + \vv</m> is in <m>W</m> (that is,

            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              whenever <m>\vu</m> is in <m>W</m> and <m>a</m> is a scalar it is also true that <m>a\vu</m> is in <m>W</m> (that is,

    There are several important points that we can glean from <xref ref="act_3_a_1"></xref>.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          A subspace is a vector space within a larger vector space,
          similar to a subset being a set within a larger set.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The set containing the zero vector in <m>\R^n</m> is a subspace of <m>\R^n</m>,
          and it is the only finite subspace of <m>\R^n</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Every subspace of <m>\R^n</m> must contain the zero vector.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          No nonzero subspace is bounded <mdash/> since a subspace must include all scalar multiples of its vectors,
          a subspace cannot be contained in a finite sphere or box.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Since vectors in <m>\R^k</m> have <m>k</m> components,
          vectors in <m>\R^k</m> are not contained in <m>\R^n</m> when <m>n \neq k</m>.
          However, if <m>n > k</m>,
          then we can think of <m>\R^n</m> as containing a <em>copy</em>
          (what we call an isomorphic image)
          of <m>\R^k</m> as the set of vectors with zeros as the last <m>n-k</m> components.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
