  <title>The Subspace Spanned by a Set of Vectors</title>
  <p>
    One of the most convenient ways to represent a subspace of <m>\R^n</m> is as the span of a set of vectors.
    In Preview <xref ref="pa_3_a">Activity</xref>
    we saw that the span of two vectors is a subspace of <m>\R^n</m>.
    In the next theorem we verify this result for the span of an arbitrary number of vectors,
    extending the ideas you used in Preview <xref ref="pa_3_a">Activity</xref>.
    Expressing a set of vectors as the span of some number of vectors is a quick way of justifying that this set is a subspace and it also provides us a geometric intuition for the set of vectors.

  <theorem xml:id="thm_3_a_span_subspace">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\vv_1</m>, <m>\vv_2</m>,
        <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\vv_k</m> be vectors in <m>\R^n</m>.
        Then <m>\Span \{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_k\}</m> is a subspace of <m>\R^n</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>\vv_1</m>, <m>\vv_2</m>,
      <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\vv_k</m> be vectors in <m>\R^n</m>.
      Let <m>W = \Span\{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_k\}</m>.
      To show that <m>W</m> is a subspace of <m>\R^n</m> we need to show that <m>W</m> is closed under addition and multiplication by scalars and that <m>\vzero</m> is in <m>W</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      First we show that <m>W</m> is closed under addition.
      Let <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vw</m> be vectors in <m>W</m>.
      This means that <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vw</m> are linear combinations of <m>\vv_1</m>,
      <m>\vv_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\vv_k</m>.
      So there are scalars <m>a_1</m>,
      <m>a_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
      <m>a_k</m> and <m>b_1</m>, <m>b_2</m>,
      <m>\ldots</m>, <m>b_k</m> so that
      <me>
        \vu = a_1\vv_1 + a_2\vv_2 + \cdots + a_k \vv_k \ \ \ \ \ \text{ and }  \ \ \ \ \ \vw = b_1\vv_1 + b_2\vv_2 + \cdots + b_k \vv_k
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To demonstrate that <m>\vu + \vw</m> is in <m>W</m>,
      we need to show that <m>\vu + \vw</m> is a linear combination of <m>\vv_1</m>,
      <m>\vv_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\vv_k</m>.
      Using the properties of vector addition and scalar multiplication, we find
      <md>
        <mrow>\vu + \vw \amp = (a_1\vv_1 + a_2\vv_2 + \cdots + a_k \vv_k) + (b_1\vv_1 + b_2\vv_2 + \cdots + b_k \vv_k)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = (a_1+b_1)\vv_1 + (a_2+b_2)\vv_2 + \cdots + (a_k+b_k) \vv_k</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus <m>\vu + \vw</m> is a linear combination of <m>\vv_1</m>,
      <m>\vv_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
      <m>\vv_k</m> and <m>W</m> is closed under vector addition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next we show that <m>W</m> is closed under scalar multiplication.
      Let <m>\vu</m> be in <m>W</m> and <m>c</m> be a scalar.
      Then
      <me>
        c\vu = c(a_1\vv_1 + a_2\vv_2 + \cdots + a_k \vv_k) = (ca_1)\vv_1 + (ca_2)\vv_2 + \cdots + (ca_k) \vv_k
      </me>
      and <m>c\vu</m> is a linear combination of <m>\vv_1</m>,
      <m>\vv_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
      <m>\vv_k</m> and <m>W</m> is closed under multiplication by scalars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, we show that <m>\vzero</m> is in <m>W</m>.
      Since
      <me>
        \vzero = 0\vv_1 + 0\vv_2 + \cdots + 0 \vv_k \,
      </me>,
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>\vzero</m> is in <m>W</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since <m>W</m> satisfies all of the properties of a subspace as given in definition of a subspace,
      we conclude that <m>W</m> is a subspace of <m>\R^n</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <p>
    The subspace <m>W=\Span\{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_k\}</m> is called the
    <em>subspace of <m>\R^n</m> spanned by <m>\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_k</m></em>.
    We also use the phrase ``subspace generated by <m>\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_k</m>" since the vectors
    <m>\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_k</m> are the building blocks of all vectors in <m>W</m>.

            Express the following set of vectors as the span of some vectors to show that this set is a subspace.
            Can you give a geometric description of the set?
            <me>
              W = \left\{ \left[ \begin{array}{c} 2x+y-z \\ y \\ z \\ -x+3z \end{array}  \right]: x, y, z \text{ real numbers }  \right \}

          </p>

  <p>
    One additional conclusion we can draw from <xref ref="act_3_a_1">Activities</xref>
    and <xref ref="act_3_a_2"></xref>
    is that subspaces of <m>\R^n</m> are made up of
    <q>flat</q>
    subsets.
    The span of a single nonzero vector is a line
    (which is flat),
    and the span of a set of two distinct nonzero vectors is a plane
    (which is also flat).
    So subspaces of <m>\R^n</m> are linear (or
    <q>flat</q>
    ) subsets of <m>\R^n</m>.
    That is why we can recognize that the non-flat parabola in <xref ref="act_3_a_1">Activity</xref>
    is not a subspace of <m>\R^2</m>.
