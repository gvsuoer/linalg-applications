  <title>Bases</title>
  <p>
    A basis for a vector space is a spanning set that is as small as it can be.
    We already saw how to define bases formally in <m>\R^n</m>.
    We will now formally define a basis for a vector space and understand why with this definition a basis is a minimal spanning set.
    Bases are important because any vector in a vector space can be uniquely represented as a linear combination of basis vectors.
    We will see in later sections that this representation will allow us to identify any vector space with a basis of <m>n</m> vectors with <m>\R^n</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    To obtain the formal definition of a basis,
    which is a minimal spanning set,
    we consider what additional property makes a spanning set a
    <em>minimal</em> spanning set.
    As a consequence of <xref ref="thm_5_b_3">Theorem</xref>,
    if <m>S</m> is a spanning set that is linearly dependent,
    then we can find a proper subset of <m>S</m> that has the same span.
    Thus, the set <m>S</m> cannot be a minimal spanning set.
    However, if <m>S</m> is linearly independent,
    then no vector in <m>S</m> is a linear combination of the others and we need all of the vectors in <m>S</m> to form the span.
    This leads us to the following formal characterization of a minimal spanning set,
    called a <em>basis</em>.

        for a vector space <m>V</m> is a subset <m>S</m> of <m>V</m> if

  <p>
    In other words,
    a basis for a vector space <m>V</m> is a linearly independent spanning set for <m>V</m>.
    To put it another way,
    a basis for a vector space is a minimal spanning set for the vector space.
    Similar reasoning will show that a basis is also a maximal linearly independent set.

    The key ideas to take from the previous theorems are:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          A basis for a vector space <m>V</m> is a minimal spanning set for <m>V</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A basis for <m>V</m> is a subset <m>S</m> of <m>V</m> so that
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>S</m> spans <m>V</m> and
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>S</m> is linearly independent.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          No vector in a basis can be written as a linear combination of the other vectors in the basis.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If a subset <m>S</m> of a vector space <m>V</m> has the property that one of the vectors in <m>S</m> is a linear combination of the other vectors in <m>S</m>,
          then <m>S</m> is not a basis for <m>V</m>.
        </p>

    </ul>

    As an example of a basis of a vector space,
    we saw in <xref ref="pa_5_b"></xref>
    that the set <m>S = \{1-t, 1+t\}</m> is both linearly independent and spans <m>\pol_1</m>,
    and so <m>S</m> is a basis for <m>\pol_1</m>.

    It should be noted that not every vector space has a finite basis.
    For example,
    the space <m>\pol</m> of all polynomials with real coefficients
    (of any degree)
    is a vector space,
    but no finite set of vectors will span <m>\pol</m>.
    In fact, the infinite set <m>\{1, t, t^2, \ldots\}</m> is both linearly independent and spans <m>\pol</m>,
    so <m>\pol</m> has an infinite basis.
