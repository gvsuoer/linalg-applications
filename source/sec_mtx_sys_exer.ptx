        What are the possible geometrical descriptions of the solution set of two linear 
        equations in <m>\R^3</m>? (Recall that <m>\R^3</m> is the three-dimensional 
        <m>xyz</m>-space <mdash/> that is,
        the set of all ordered triples of the form <m>(x,y,z)</m>).

    <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Two students are talking about when a linear system has infinitely many solutions.
        <blockquote>
          Student 1: So, if we have a linear system whose augmented matrix has a row of zeros, then the system has infinitely many solutions, doesn't it?
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          Student 2: Well, but what if there is a row of the form <m>[\, 0\, 0\, \ldots\, 0\, |\, b\, ]</m> with a non-zero <m>b</m> right above the row of 0's?
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          Student 1: OK, maybe I should ask
          <q>If we have a consistent linear system whose augmented matrix has a row of zeros, then the system has infinitely many solutions, doesn't it?</q>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          Student 2: I don't know. It still doesn't sound enough to me, but I'm not sure why.
        </blockquote>
        Is Student 1 right?
        Or is Student 2's hunch correct?
        Justify your answer with a specific example if possible.

    <answer>
      <p>
        Student 2's hunch is correct.
