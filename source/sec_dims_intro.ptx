    In <xref ref="sec_bases_dimension"></xref>
    we learned that any two bases for a subspace of <m>\R^n</m> contain the same number of vectors.
    This allowed us to define the dimension of a subspace of <m>\R^n</m>.
    In this section we extend the arguments we made in <xref ref="sec_bases_dimension"></xref>
    to arbitrary vector spaces and define the dimension of a vector space.

      The main tool we used to prove that any two bases for a subspace of <m>\R^n</m> must contain the same number of elements was <xref ref="thm_3_d_1"></xref>.
      In this preview activity we will show that the same argument can be used for vector spaces.
      More specifically,
      we will prove a special case of the following theorem generalizing <xref ref="thm_3_d_1"></xref>.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm_5_c_1">
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>V</m> is a vector space with a basis <m>\CB = \{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_k\}</m> of <m>k</m> vectors,
          then any subset of <m>V</m> containing more than <m>k</m> vectors is linearly dependent.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      Suppose <m>V</m> is a vector space with basis <m>\CB = \{\vv_1, \vv_2\}</m>.
      Consider the set <m>U=\{\vu_1, \vu_2, \vu_3\}</m> of vectors in <m>V</m>.
      We will show that <m>U</m> is linearly dependent using a similar approach to the <xref ref="pa_3_d"></xref>.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            What vector equation involving
            <m>\vu_1, \vu_2, \vu_3</m> do we need to solve to determine linear independence/dependence of these vectors?
            Use <m>x_1, x_2, x_3</m> for coefficients.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Since <m>\CB</m> is a basis of <m>V</m>, it spans <m>V</m>.
            Using this information,
            rewrite the vectors <m>\vu_i</m> in terms of <m>\vv_j</m> and substitute into the above equation to obtain another equation in terms of <m>\vv_j</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Since <m>\CB</m> is a basis of <m>V</m>,
            the vectors <m>\vv_1, \vv_2</m> are linearly independent.
            Using the equation in the previous part,
            determine what this means about the coefficients <m>x_1, x_2, x_3</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Express the conditions on <m>x_1, x_2, x_3</m> in the form of a matrix-vector equation.
            Explain why there are infinitely many solutions for <m>x_i</m>'s and why this means the vectors
            <m>\vu_1, \vu_2, \vu_3</m> are linearly dependent.
