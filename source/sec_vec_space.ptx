  <title>Vector Spaces</title>
  <p>
    We defined vector spaces in the context of subspaces of <m>\R^n</m> in <xref ref="def_3_a_1"></xref>.
    In general, any set that has the same kind of additive and multiplicative structure as our sets of vectors,
    matrices, and linear polynomials is called a vector space.
    As we will see,
    the ideas that we introduced about subspaces of <m>\R^n</m> apply to vector spaces in general,
    so the material in this chapter should have a familiar feel.

  <note>
    <p>
      Unless otherwise stated, in this book the scalars
          <idx><h>scalars</h></idx>
      will refer to real numbers.
      However, we can define vector spaces where scalars are complex numbers,
      or rational numbers,
      or integers modulo <m>p</m> where <m>p</m> is a prime number, or,
      more generally, elements of a field.
      A field is an algebraic structure which generalizes the structure of real numbers and rational numbers under the addition and multiplication operations.
      Since we will focus on the real numbers as scalars,
      the reader is not required to be familiar with the concept of a field.

    Because of the similarity of the way elements in vector spaces behave compared to vectors in <m>\R^n</m>,
    we call the elements in a vector space <em>vectors</em>.
    There are many examples of vectors spaces,
    which is what makes this idea so powerful.

              The space <m>\R^n</m> of all vectors with <m>n</m> components is a vector space using the standard vector addition and multiplication by scalars.
              The zero element is the zero vector <m>\vzero</m> whose components are all 0.

              The set <m>\pol_1</m> of all polynomials of degree less than or equal to 1 with addition and scalar multiplication as defined earlier.
              Recall that <m>\pol_1</m> is essentially the same as <m>\R^2</m>.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The properties listed in the introduction for <m>\pol_1</m> are equally true for the collection of all polynomials of degree less than or equal to some fixed number.
              We label as <m>\pol_n</m> this set of all polynomials of degree less than or equal to <m>n</m>,
              with the standard addition and scalar multiplication.
              Note that <m>\pol_n</m> is essentially the same as <m>\R^{n+1}</m>.
              More generally,
              the space <m>\pol</m> of all polynomials is also a vector space with standard addition and scalar multiplication.

              The span of a set of vectors in <m>\R^n</m> is a subspace of <m>\R^n</m>,

              The set <m>\{\vzero\}</m> is a vector space in which <m>\vzero + \vzero = \vzero</m> and
              <m>k\vzero = \vzero</m> for any scalar <m>k</m>.
              This space is called the <em>trivial</em> vector space.

              <m>m \times n</m> matrices with real entries with the standard addition and multiplication by scalars we have already defined.
              In this case,

              We define addition and scalar multiplication termwise:
              <me>
                (x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots) + (y_1, y_2, y_3, \ldots) = (x_1+y_1, x_2+y_2, x_3+y_3, \ldots) \,

              is a vector space.
              In addition, the set of convergent sequences inside
              <m>\R^\infty</m> forms a vector space using this addition and multiplication by scalars
              (as we did in <m>\R^n</m>,
              we will call this set of convergent sequences a subspace of <m>\R^{\infty}</m>).

              does not define a vector space.
              The color space is not closed under either operation due to the color coordinates being integers ranging from 0 to 255.

  <p>
    It is important to note that the set of defining properties of a vector space is intended to be a minimum set.
    Any other properties of a vector space must be verified or proved using the defining properties.
    For example,
    in <m>\R^n</m> it is clear that the scalar multiple <m>0\vv</m> is the zero vector for any vector <m>\vv</m> in <m>\R^n</m>.
    This might be true in any vector space,
    but it is not a defining property.
    Therefore, if this property is true,
    then we must be able to prove it using just the defining properties.
    To see how this might work,
    let <m>\vv</m> be any vector in a vector space <m>V</m>.
    We want to show that <m>0 \vv = \vzero</m> (the existence of the zero vector is property (4)).
    Using the fact that <m>0+0 = 0</m> and that scalar multiplication distributes over scalar addition,
    we can see that
    <me>
      0\vv = (0+0)\vv = 0\vv + 0\vv
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Property (5) tells us that <m>V</m> contains an additive inverse for every vector in <m>V</m>,
    so let <m>\vu</m> be an additive inverse of the vector <m>0\vv</m> in <m>V</m>.
    Then <m>0\vv + \vu = \vzero</m><fn>
    It is very important to keep track of the different kinds of zeros here <mdash/> the boldface zero <m>\vzero</m> is the additive identity in the vector space and the non-bold 0 is the scalar zero.
    </fn> and so
    <md>
      <mrow>0\vv + \vu \amp = (0\vv + 0\vv) + \vu</mrow>
      <mrow>\vzero \amp = 0\vv + (0\vv + \vu)</mrow>
      <mrow>\vzero \amp = 0\vv + \vzero</mrow>
    </md>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now <m>\vzero</m> has the property that
    <m>\vzero + \vw = \vw+ \vzero = \vw</m> for any vector <m>\vw</m> in <m>V</m> (by properties (4) and (2)),
    and so we can conclude that
    <me>
      \vzero = 0\vv
    </me>.
  </p>
  <activity xml:id="act_5_a_1">
    <p>
      Another property that will be useful is a cancellation property.
      In the set of real numbers we know that if <m>a+b = c+b</m>,
      then <m>a=c</m>,
      and we verify this by subtracting <m>b</m> from both sides.
      This is the same as adding the additive inverse of <m>b</m> to both sides,
      so we ought to be able to make the same argument using additive inverses in a vector space.
      To see how, let <m>\vu</m>, <m>\vv</m>,
      and <m>\vw</m> be vectors in a vector space and suppose that
      <men xml:id="eq_5_a_1">
        \vu + \vw = \vv + \vw
      </men>.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Why does our space contain an additive inverse <m>\vz</m> of <m>\vw</m>?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Now add the vector <m>\vz</m> to both sides of equation <xref ref="eq_5_a_1"/> to obtain
            <men xml:id="eq_5_a_2">
              (\vu+\vw) + \vz = (\vv+\vw) + \vz
            </men>.
            Which property of a vector space allows us to state the following equality?
            <men xml:id="eq_5_a_3">
              \vu+(\vw+\vz) = \vv+(\vw+\vz)
            </men>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Now use the properties of additive inverses and the additive identity to explain why <m>\vu = \vv</m>.
            Conclude that we have a cancellation law for addition in any vector space.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </activity>
  <p>
    We should also note that the definition of a vector space only states the existence of a zero vector and an additive inverse for each vector in the space,
    and does not say that there cannot be more than one zero vector or more than one additive inverse of a vector in the space.
    The reason why is that the uniqueness of the zero vector and an additive inverse of a vector can be proved from the defining properties of a vector space,
    and so we don't list this consequence as a defining property.
    Similarly, the defining properties of a vector space do not state that the additive inverse of a vector <m>\vv</m> is the scalar multiple <m>(-1)\vv</m>.
    Verification of these properties are left for the exercises.
    We summarize the results of this section in the following theorem.
