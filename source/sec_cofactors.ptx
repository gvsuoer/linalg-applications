  <p>
    We will now define the determinant of a general
    <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> in terms of a cofactor expansion as we did in the <m>3 \times 3</m> case.
    To do so, we need some notation and terminology.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          We let <m>A_{ij}</m> be the submatrix of
          <m>A = [a_{ij}]</m> found by deleting the <m>i</m>th row and <m>j</m>th column of <m>A</m>.
          The determinant of <m>A_{ij}</m> is called the <m>ij</m>th <term>minor</term>
          of <m>A</m> or the minor corresponding to the entry <m>a_{ij}</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Notice that in the <m>3 \times 3</m> case,
          we used the opposite of the 1,2 minor in the sum.
          It will be the case that the terms in the cofactor expansion will alternate in sign.
          We can make the signs in the sum alternate by taking <m>-1</m> to an appropriate power.
          As a result, we define the <m>ij</m>th <term>cofactor</term>
          <m>C_{ij}</m> of <m>A</m> as
          <me>
            C_{ij} = (-1)^{i+j} \det\left(A_{ij}\right)
          </me>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Finally, we define the determinant of <m>A</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>A=[a_{ij}]</m> is an <m>n \times n</m> matrix,
        the <term>determinant</term>
            
        of <m>A</m> is the scalar
        <me>
          \det(A) = a_{11}C_{11} + a_{12}C_{12} + a_{13}C_{13} + \cdots + a_{1n}C_{1n}
        </me>
        where <m>C_{ij}= (-1)^{i+j} \det(A_{ij})</m> is the <m>ij</m>-cofactor of <m>A</m> and <m>A_{ij}</m> is the matrix obtained by removing row <m>i</m> and column <m>j</m> of matrix <m>A</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    This method for computing determinants is called the
    <term>cofactor expansion</term> or
    <term>Laplace expansion</term>
    of <m>A</m> along the 1st row.
    The cofactor expansion reduces the computation of the determinant of an
    <m>n \times n</m> matrix to <m>n</m> computations of determinants of <m>(n-1) \times (n-1)</m> matrices.
    These smaller matrices can be reduced again using cofactor expansions,
    so it can be a long and grueling process for large matrices.
    It turns out that we can actually take this expansion along any row or column of the matrix (a proof of this fact is given in <xref ref="chap_det_properties"></xref>).
    For example, the cofactor expansion along the 2nd row is
    <me>
      \det(A) = a_{21}C_{21} + a_{22}C_{22} + \cdots + a_{2n}C_{2n}
    </me>
    and along the 3rd column the formula is
    <me>
      \det(A) = a_{13}C_{13} + a_{23}C_{23} + \cdots + a_{n3}C_{n3}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that when finding a cofactor expansion,
    choosing a row or column with many zeros makes calculations easier.

    As with any new idea, like the determinant,
    we must ask what properties are satisfied.
    We state the following theorem without proof for the time being.
    For the interested reader,
    the proof of many of these properties is given in <xref ref="chap_det_properties"></xref> and others in the exercises.

              The determinant of a matrix is the product of the eigenvalues,

  <p>
    Note that if we were to find the determinant of a
    <m>4\times 4</m> matrix using the cofactor method,
    we will calculate determinants of 4 matrices of size <m>3\times 3</m>,
    each of which will require 3 determinant calculations again.
    So, we will need a total of 12 calculations of determinants of <m>2\times 2</m> matrices.
    That is a lot of calculations.
    There are other, more efficient,
    methods for calculating determinants.
    For example, we can row reduce the matrix,
    keeping track of the effect that each row operation has on the determinant.
