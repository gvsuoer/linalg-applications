    What follows are worked examples that use the concepts from this section.

  <example>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Let <m>\vv_1 = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1\\2\\0\\1 \end{array} \right]</m>,
        <m>\vv_2 = \left[ \begin{array}{r} 0\\6\\-1\\5 \end{array} \right]</m>,
        <m>\vv_3 = \left[ \begin{array}{r} 3\\-6\\2\\-7 \end{array} \right]</m>,
        and <m>\vv_4 = \left[ \begin{array}{r} 5\\-2\\2\\-5 \end{array} \right]</m>.
      </p>
    </introduction>
        <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Is the set <m>S = \{\vv_1, \vv_2, \vv_3, \vv_4\}</m> linearly independent or 
              dependent.
              If independent, explain why.
              If dependent,
              write one of the vectors in <m>S</m> as a linear combination of the other vectors 
              in <m>S</m>.
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              We need to know the solutions to the vector equation
              <me>
                x_1 \vv_1 + x_2 \vv_2 + x_3 \vv_3 + x_4 \vv_4 = \vzero
              </me>.
              If the equation has as its only solution <m>x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = x_4 = 0</m>
              (the trivial solution),
              then the set <m>S</m> is linearly independent.
              Otherwise the set <m>S</m> is linearly dependent.
              To find the solutions to this system,
              we row reduce the augmented matrix
              <me>
                \left[ \begin{array}{crrr|c} 1\amp 0\amp 3\amp 5\amp 0 \\ 2\amp 6\amp -6\amp -2\amp 0 \\ 0\amp -1\amp 2\amp 2\amp 0 \\ 1\amp 5\amp -7\amp -5\amp 0 \end{array}  \right]
              </me>.
              (Note that we really don't need the augmented column of zeros <mdash/> row 
              operations won't change that column at all.
              We just need to know that the column of zeros is there.) Technology shows
              that the reduced row echelon form of this augmented matrix is
              <me>
                \left[ \begin{array}{cccr|c} 1\amp 0\amp 3\amp 5\amp 0 \\ 0\amp 1\amp -2\amp -2\amp 0 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0 \end{array}  \right]
              </me>.
              The reduced row echelon form tells us that the vector equation is consistent,
              and the fact that there is no pivot in the fourth column shows that the system 
              has a free variable and more than just the trivial solution.
              We conclude that <m>S</m> is linearly dependent.
              Moreover, the general solution to our vector equation is
              <md>
                <mrow>x_1 \amp = -3x_3 - 5x_4</mrow>
                <mrow>x_2 \amp = 2x_3 + 2x_4</mrow>
                <mrow>x_3 \amp \text{ is free }</mrow>
                <mrow>x_4 \amp \text{ is free } </mrow>
              </md>.
              Letting <m>x_4 = 0</m> and <m>x_3 = 1</m> shows that one non-trivial solution 
              to our vector equation is
              <me>
                x_1 = -3, \ x_2 = 2, \ x_3 = 1, \ \text{ and }  \ x_4 = 0
              </me>.
              Thus,
              <me>
                -3\vv_1 + 2\vv_2 + \vv_3 = \vzero
              </me>,
              or
              <me>
                \vv_3 = 3\vv_1 - 2\vv_2
              </me>
              and we have written one vector in <m>S</m> as a linear combination of the 
              other vectors in <m>S</m>.
            </p>
          </solution>

        <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Find a subset <m>B</m> of <m>S</m> that is a basis for <m>\Span \ S</m>.
              Explain how you know you have a basis.
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              We have seen that the pivot columns in a matrix <m>A</m> form a minimal spanning set
              (or basis)
              for the span of the columns of <m>A</m>.
              From part (a) we see that the pivot columns in the reduced row echelon form of
              <m>A = [\vv_1 \ \vv_2 \ \vv_3 \ \vv_4]</m> are the first and second columns.
              So a basis for the span of the columns of <m>A</m> is <m>\{\vv_1, \vv_2\}</m>.
              Since the elements of <m>S</m> are the columns of <m>A</m>,
              we conclude that the set <m>B = \{\vv_1, \vv_2\}</m> is a subset of <m>S</m> 
              that is a basis for <m>\Span \ S</m>.

  <example>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Let <m>\vv_1 = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{array} \right]</m>,
        <m>\vv_2 = \left[ \begin{array}{r} 3 \\ -7 \\ 2 \end{array} \right]</m>,
        and <m>\vv_3 = \left[ \begin{array}{r} -5 \\ 6 \\ 10 \end{array} \right]</m>.
      </p>
    </introduction>
        <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Is the set <m>S = \left\{\vv_1, \vv_2, \vv_3\right\}</m> a basis for <m>\R^3</m>?
              Explain.
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              We need to know if the vectors in <m>S</m> are linearly independent and span 
              <m>\R^3</m>.
              Technology shows that the reduced row echelon form of
              <me>
                A=\left[ \begin{array}{crr} 1\amp 3\amp -5 \\ 1\amp -7\amp 6 \\ 0\amp 2\amp 10 \end{array}  \right]
              </me>
              is
              <me>
                \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} 1\amp 0\amp 0 \\ 0\amp 1\amp 0 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 1 \end{array}  \right]
              </me>.
              Since every column of <m>[\vv_1 \ \vv_2 \ \vv_3]</m> is a pivot column,
              the set <m>\{\vv_1, \vv_2, \vv_3\}</m> is linearly independent.
              The fact that there is a pivot in every row of the matrix <m>A</m> means that 
              the equation
              <m>A \vx = \vb</m> is consistent for every <m>\vb</m> in <m>\R^3</m>.
              Since <m>A \vx</m> is a linear combination of the columns of <m>A</m> with 
              weights from <m>\vx</m>,
              tt follows that the columns of <m>A</m> span <m>\R^3</m>.
              We conclude that the set <m>S</m> is a basis for <m>\R^3</m>.
            </p>
          </solution>
        </task>
        <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Let <m>\vv_4 = \left[ \begin{array}{r} -5 \\ 6 \\ h \end{array} \right]</m>,
              where <m>h</m> is a scalar.
              Are there any values of <m>h</m> for which the set
              <m>S' = \{\vv_1, \vv_2, \vv_4\}</m> is not a basis for <m>\R^3</m>?
              If so, find all such values of <m>h</m> and explain why <m>S'</m> is not a 
              basis for <m>\R^3</m> for those values of <m>h</m>.
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              Technology shows that a row echelon form of <m>A = [\vv_1 \ \vv_2 \ \vv_4]</m> is
              <me>
                \left[  \begin{array}{crc} 1\amp 0\amp 0 \\ 0\amp -10\amp 11 \\ 0\amp 0\amp h+\frac{11}{5} \end{array}  \right]
              </me>.
              The columns of <m>A</m> are all pivot columns
              (hence linearly independent)
              as long as <m>h \neq -\frac{11}{5}</m>,
              and are linearly dependent when <m>h = -\frac{11}{5}</m>.
              So the only value of <m>h</m> for which <m>S'</m> is not a basis for <m>\R^3</m> 
              is <m>h = -\frac{11}{5}</m>.
