  <title>Application: The Hat Puzzle</title>
  <p>
    In a New York Times article (April 10, 2001)
    <q>Why Mathematicians Now Care About Their Hat Color</q>, the following puzzle is posed.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <q>Three players enter a room and a red or blue hat is placed on each person's head. The color of each hat is determined by a coin toss, with the outcome of one coin toss having no effect on the others. Each person can see the other players' hats but not his own.
    No communication of any sort is allowed, except for an initial strategy session before the game begins. Once they have had a chance to look at the other hats, the players must simultaneously guess the color of their own hats or pass. The group shares a hypothetical $3 million prize if at least one player guesses correctly and no players guess incorrectly.</q>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    The game can be played with more players,
    and the problem is to find a strategy for the group that maximizes its chance of winning.
    One strategy is for a designated player to make a random guess and for the others to pass.
    This gives a 50% chance of winning.
    However, there are much better strategies that provide a nearly 100% probability of winning as the number of players increases.
    One such strategy is based on Hamming codes and subspaces of a particular vector space to implement the most effective approach.
