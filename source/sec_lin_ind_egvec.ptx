  <title>Linearly Independent Eigenvectors</title>
  <p>
    An important question we will want to answer about a matrix is how many linearly independent eigenvectors the matrix has.
    <xref ref="act_3_c_1"></xref>
    shows that eigenvectors for the same eigenvalue may be linearly dependent or independent,
    but all of our examples so far seem to indicate that eigenvectors corresponding to different eigenvalues are linearly independent.
    This turns out to be universally true as our next theorem demonstrates.
    The next activity should help prepare us for the proof of this theorem

      Let <m>\lambda_1</m> and <m>\lambda_2</m> be distinct eigenvalues of a matrix <m>A</m> with corresponding eigenvectors <m>\vv_1</m> and <m>\vv_2</m>.
      The goal of this activity is to demonstrate that <m>\vv_1</m> and <m>\vv_2</m> are linearly independent.
      To prove that <m>\vv_1</m> and <m>\vv_2</m> are linearly independent,
      suppose that

  <theorem xml:id="thm_4_b_lin_indep_evects">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\lambda_1</m>, <m>\lambda_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
        <m>\lambda_k</m> be <m>k</m> distinct eigenvalues for a matrix <m>A</m> and for each <m>i</m> between 1 and <m>k</m> let <m>\vv_i</m> be an eigenvector of <m>A</m> with eigenvalue <m>\lambda_i</m>.
        Then the vectors <m>\vv_1</m>,
        <m>\vv_2</m>,
        <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\vv_k</m> are linearly independent.
      </p>
    </statement>
  
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>A</m> be a matrix with <m>k</m> distinct eigenvalues <m>\lambda_1</m>,
      <m>\lambda_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
      <m>\lambda_k</m> and corresponding eigenvectors <m>\vv_1</m>,
      <m>\vv_2</m>,
      <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\vv_k</m>.
      To understand why <m>\vv_1</m>,
      <m>\vv_2</m>,
      <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\vv_k</m> are linearly independent,
      we will argue by contradiction and suppose that the vectors <m>\vv_1</m>,
      <m>\vv_2</m>,
      <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\vv_k</m> are linearly dependent.
      Note that <m>\vv_1</m> cannot be the zero vector (why?), so the set
      <m>S_1=\{\vv_1\}</m> is linearly independent.
      If we include <m>\vv_2</m> into this set,
      the set <m>S_2 = \{\vv_1, \vv_2\}</m> may be linearly independent or dependent.
      If <m>S_2</m> is linearly independent,
      then the set <m>S_3 = \{\vv_1, \vv_2, \vv_3\}</m> may be linearly independent or dependent.
      We can continue adding additional vectors until we reach the set
      <m>S_k = \{\vv_1, \vv_2, \vv_3, \ldots, \vv_k\}</m> which we are assuming is linearly dependent.
      So there must be a smallest integer
      <m>m \geq 2</m> such that the set <m>S_m</m> is linearly dependent while <m>S_{m-1}</m> is linearly independent.
      Since <m>S_m = \{\vv_1, \vv_2, \vv_3, \ldots, \vv_m\}</m> is linearly dependent,
      there is a linear combination of <m>\vv_1</m>,
      <m>\vv_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
      <m>\vv_m</m> with weights not all 0 that is the zero vector.
      Let <m>c_1</m>, <m>c_2</m>,
      <m>\ldots</m>, <m>c_m</m> be such weights, not all zero, so that
      <men xml:id="eq_distinct_eigenvalues">
        c_1\vv_1 + c_2\vv_2 + \cdots + c_{m-1} \vv_{m-1} + c_m \vv_m = \vzero
      </men>
    </p>
    <p>
      If we multiply both sides of <xref ref="eq_distinct_eigenvalues"/> on the left by the matrix <m>A</m> we obtain
      <md>
        <mrow>A(c_1\vv_1 + c_{2}\vv_{2} + \cdots + c_m \vv_m) \amp = A\vzero</mrow>
        <mrow>c_1A\vv_1 + c_{2}A\vv_{2} + \cdots + c_m A\vv_m \amp = \vzero</mrow>
        <mrow xml:id="eq_distinct_eigenvalues2" number="yes">c_1 \lambda_1\vv_1 + c_{2}\lambda_{2}\vv_{2} + \cdots + c_m \lambda_m\vv_m \amp = \vzero</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we multiply both sides of <xref ref="eq_distinct_eigenvalues"/> by
      <m>\lambda_m</m> we obtain the equation
      <men xml:id="eq_distinct_eigenvalues3">
        c_1\lambda_m\vv_1 + c_{2}\lambda_m\vv_{2} + \cdots + c_m \lambda_m\vv_m = \vzero
      </men>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subtracting corresponding sides of equation <xref ref="eq_distinct_eigenvalues3"/> from <xref ref="eq_distinct_eigenvalues2"/> gives us
      <men xml:id="eq_distinct_eigenvalues4">
        c_{1}(\lambda_{1}-\lambda_m)\vv_{1} + c_{2}(\lambda_{2}-\lambda_m)\vv_{2} + \cdots + c_{m-1} (\lambda_{m-1}-\lambda_m) \vv_{m-1} = \vzero
      </men>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recall that <m>S_{m-1}</m> is a linearly independent set,
      so the only way a linear combination of vectors in <m>S_{m-1}</m> can be <m>\vzero</m> is if all of the weights are 0.
      Therefore, we must have
      <me>
        c_{1}(\lambda_{1}-\lambda_m) = 0, \ \ c_{2}(\lambda_{2}-\lambda_m) = 0, \ \ \ldots, \ \ c_{m-1} (\lambda_{m-1}-\lambda_m) = 0
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the eigenvalues are all distinct, this can only happen if
      <me>
        c_1 = c_2 = \cdots = c_{m-1} = 0
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But equation <xref ref="eq_distinct_eigenvalues"/> then implies that <m>c_m = 0</m> and so all of the weights <m>c_1</m>,
      <m>c_2</m>,
      <m>\ldots</m>, <m>c_m</m> are 0.
      However, when we assumed that the eigenvectors <m>\vv_1</m>,
      <m>\vv_2</m>,
      <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\vv_k</m> were linearly dependent,
      this led to having at least one of the weights <m>c_1</m>,
      <m>c_2</m>,
      <m>\ldots</m>, <m>c_m</m> be nonzero.
      This cannot happen,
      so our assumption that the eigenvectors <m>\vv_1</m>,
      <m>\vv_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
      <m>\vv_k</m> were linearly dependent must be false and we conclude that the eigenvectors <m>\vv_1</m>,
      <m>\vv_2</m>,
      <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\vv_k</m> are linearly independent.
