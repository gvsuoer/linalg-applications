    Recall that a subspace of <m>\R^n</m> is a subset of <m>\R^n</m> which is a vector space in itself.
    More specifically,
    a subset <m>W</m> or <m>\R^n</m> is a subspace of <m>\R^n</m> if
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          whenever <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> are in <m>W</m> it is also true that
          <m>\vu + \vv</m> is in <m>W</m> (that is,
          <m>W</m> is <term>closed</term> under addition),
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          whenever <m>\vu</m> is in <m>W</m> and <m>a</m> is a scalar it is also true that <m>a\vu</m> is in <m>W</m> (that is,
          <m>W</m> is <term>closed</term> under scalar multiplication),
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>\vzero</m> is in <m>W</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    Given a matrix <m>A</m>,
    there are several subspaces that are connected to <m>A</m>.
    Two specific such subspaces are the null space of <m>A</m> and the column space of <m>A</m>.
    We will see that these subspaces provide answers to the big questions we have been considering since the beginning of the semester, such as
    <q>Do columns of <m>A</m> span <m>\R^m</m>?</q>
    <q>Are the columns of <m>A</m> linearly independent?</q>
    <q>Is the transformation <m>T</m> defined by matrix multiplication by <m>A</m> one-to-one?</q>
    <q>Is the transformation <m>T</m> onto?</q>
  </p>

    In this preview activity, we start examining the <term>null space</term>.

                  (Recall that the parametric vector form expresses the solutions to an equation as linear combinations of vectors with free variables as the weights.
                  An example would be <m>x_3 \left[ \begin{array}{r} 1\\0\\-1\\0 \end{array} \right] + x_4 \left[ \begin{array}{r} -2\\1\\0\\1 \end{array} \right]</m>.)

                  What does the above seem to indicate about the set of solutions to the homogeneous system <m>A \vx = \vzero</m>?

            Let <m>A</m> be an <m>m \times n</m> matrix.
            As problem 1 implies,
            the set of solutions to a homogeneous matrix-vector equation
            <m>A \vx = \vzero</m> appears to be a subspace.
            We give a special name to this set.

              <statement>
                <p>
                  The <term>null space</term>
                  of an <m>m \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> is the set of all solutions to <m>A \vx = \vzero</m>.
                </p>
              </statement>
            </definition>

            We denote the null space of a matrix <m>A</m> as <m>\Nul A</m>.
            In set notation we write
            <me>
              \Nul A = \{ \vx : A \vx = \vzero\}
            </me>.

            Note that since <m>A\vx=\vzero</m> corresponds to a homogeneous system of linear equations,
            <m>\Nul A</m> also represents the solution set of a homogeneous system.
            Let <m>A =  \left[ \begin{array}{cccc} 2\amp 1\amp 3\amp 0\\ 1\amp 1\amp 4\amp 1 \end{array}  \right]</m>.
            Find all vectors in <m>\Nul A</m>.

        <introduction>
          <p>
            So far we considered specific examples of null spaces.
            But what are the properties of a null space in general?
            Let <m>A</m> be an <term>arbitrary</term>
            <m>m \times n</m> matrix.

                  The null space of an <m>m \times n</m> matrix is a subset of <m>\R^k</m> for some integer <m>k</m>.
                  What is <m>k</m>?

                <p>
                  Now suppose <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> are two vectors in <m>\Nul A</m>.
                  By definition, that means <m>A\vu=\vzero</m>, <m>A\vv=\vzero</m>.
                  Use properties of the matrix-vector product to show that
                  <m>\vu + \vv</m> is also in <m>\Nul A</m>.

                  Now suppose <m>\vu</m> is a vector in <m>\Nul A</m> and <m>a</m> is a scalar.
