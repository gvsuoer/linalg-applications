    Recall that a subspace of <m>\R^n</m> is a subset of <m>\R^n</m> which is a vector space in itself.
    More specifically,
    a subset <m>W</m> or <m>\R^n</m> is a subspace of <m>\R^n</m> if
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          whenever <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> are in <m>W</m> it is also true that
          <m>\vu + \vv</m> is in <m>W</m> (that is,
          <m>W</m> is <em>closed</em> under addition),
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          whenever <m>\vu</m> is in <m>W</m> and <m>a</m> is a scalar it is also true that <m>a\vu</m> is in <m>W</m> (that is,
          <m>W</m> is <em>closed</em> under scalar multiplication),
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>\vzero</m> is in <m>W</m>.
        </p>

    Given a matrix <m>A</m>,
    there are several subspaces that are connected to <m>A</m>.
    Two specific such subspaces are the null space of <m>A</m> and the column space of <m>A</m>.
    We will see that these subspaces provide answers to the big questions we have been considering since the beginning of the semester, such as
    <q>Do columns of <m>A</m> span <m>\R^m</m>?</q>
    <q>Are the columns of <m>A</m> linearly independent?</q>
    <q>Is the transformation <m>T</m> defined by matrix multiplication by <m>A</m> one-to-one?</q>
    <q>Is the transformation <m>T</m> onto?</q>
  </p>

    In this preview activity, we start examining the <em>null space</em>.

            Let <m>A = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} 2\amp 1\amp 3\\ 1\amp 1\amp 4 \end{array} \right]</m>.

                  Find the general solution to the homogeneous equation <m>A \vx = \vzero</m>.
                  Write your solutions in parametric vector form.
                  (Recall that the parametric vector form expresses the solutions to an equation as linear combinations of vectors with free variables as the weights.
                  An example would be <m>x_3 \left[ \begin{array}{r} 1\\0\\-1\\0 \end{array} \right] + x_4 \left[ \begin{array}{r} -2\\1\\0\\1 \end{array} \right]</m>.)

                  What does the above seem to indicate about the set of solutions to the homogeneous system <m>A \vx = \vzero</m>?

            Let <m>A</m> be an <m>m \times n</m> matrix.
            As problem 1 implies,
            the set of solutions to a homogeneous matrix-vector equation
            <m>A \vx = \vzero</m> appears to be a subspace.
            We give a special name to this set.
            <definition xml:id="def_null_space">
              <statement>
                <p>
                  The <term>null space</term>
              <idx><h>null space</h></idx>
                  of an <m>m \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> is the set of all solutions to <m>A \vx = \vzero</m>.
                </p>
              </statement>
            </definition>
            We denote the null space of a matrix <m>A</m> as <m>\Nul A</m>.
            In set notation we write
            <me>
              \Nul A = \{ \vx : A \vx = \vzero\}
            </me>.
            Note that since <m>A\vx=\vzero</m> corresponds to a homogeneous system of linear equations,
            <m>\Nul A</m> also represents the solution set of a homogeneous system.
            Let <m>A =  \left[ \begin{array}{cccc} 2\amp 1\amp 3\amp 0\\ 1\amp 1\amp 4\amp 1 \end{array}  \right]</m>.
            Find all vectors in <m>\Nul A</m>.

            So far we considered specific examples of null spaces.
            But what are the properties of a null space in general?
            Let <m>A</m> be an <em>arbitrary</em>
            <m>m \times n</m> matrix.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  The null space of an <m>m \times n</m> matrix is a subset of <m>\R^k</m> for some integer <m>k</m>.
                  What is <m>k</m>?
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Now suppose <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> are two vectors in <m>\Nul A</m>.
                  By definition, that means <m>A\vu=\vzero</m>, <m>A\vv=\vzero</m>.
                  Use properties of the matrix-vector product to show that
                  <m>\vu + \vv</m> is also in <m>\Nul A</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Now suppose <m>\vu</m> is a vector in <m>\Nul A</m> and <m>a</m> is a scalar.
                  Explain why <m>a\vu</m> is also in <m>\Nul A</m>.

              <li>
                <p>
                  Explain why <m>\Nul A</m> is a subspace of <m>\R^n</m>.
