  <title>Finding the Inverse of a Matrix</title>
  <p>
    The next questions for us to address are how to tell when a matrix is invertible 
    and how to find the inverse of an invertible matrix.
    Consider a <m>2 \times 2</m> matrix <m>A</m>.
    To find the inverse matrix <m>B = [\vb_1 \ \vb_2]</m> of <m>A</m>,
    we have to solve the two matrix-vector equations 
    <m>A \vb_1 = \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}</m> and
    <m>A \vb_2= \begin{bmatrix}0 \\1 \end{bmatrix}</m> to find the columns of <m>B</m>.
    Since <m>A</m> is the coefficient matrix for both systems,
    we apply the same row operations on both systems to reduce <m>A</m> to RREF. Thus,
    instead of solving the two matrix-vector equations separately,
    we could simply have found the RREF of
    <me>
      \left[\, A \ \left| \begin{array}{cc} 1 \amp  0 \\ 0 \amp  1 \end{array} \right. \right]
    </me>
    and done all of the work in one pass.
    Note that the right hand side of the augmented matrix is now <m>I_2</m>.
    So we row reduce <m>[A \ | \ I_2]</m>,
    and if the systems are consistent,
    the reduced row echelon form of
    <m>[A \ | \ I_2]</m> must be <m>[I_2 \ | \ A^{-1}]</m>.
    You should be able to see that this same process works in any dimension.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Augment <m>A</m> with the identity matrix <m>I_n</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Apply row operations to reduce the augmented matrix <m>[A \ | \ I_n]</m>.
          If the system is consistent,
          then the reduced row echelon form of <m>[A \ | \ I_n]</m> will have the form
          <m>[I_n \ | \ B]</m> (by <xref ref="act_2_c_1"></xref> (d)).
          If the reduced row echelon form of <m>A</m> is not <m>I_n</m>,
          then this step fails and <m>A</m> is not invertible.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If <m>A</m> is row equivalent to <m>I_n</m>,
          then the matrix <m>B</m> in the second step has the property that <m>AB = I_n</m>.
          We will show later that the matrix <m>B</m> also satisfies
          <m>BA = I_n</m> and so <m>B</m> is the inverse of <m>A</m>.

      Find the inverse of each matrix
      <em>using the method above</em>, if it exists.
      Compare the result with the inverse that you get from using appropriate technology 
      to directly calculate the inverse.

  <p>
    We can use this method of finding the inverse of a matrix to derive a concrete
    formula for the inverse of a <m>2 \times 2</m> matrix:
    <men xml:id="eq_2_c_1">
      \left[ \begin{array}{cc} a\amp b \\ c\amp d \end{array}  \right]^{-1} = \frac{1}{ad-bc} \left[ \begin{array}{rr} d\amp -b \\ -c\amp a \end{array}  \right]
    </men>,
    provided that <m>ad-bc \neq 0</m>
    (see <xref ref="ex_2_c_2by2_inverse"></xref>).
    Hence, any <m>2\times 2</m> matrix
    <m>\left[ \begin{array}{cc} a\amp b \\ c\amp d \end{array}  \right]</m> has an 
    inverse if and only if <m>ad-bc\neq 0</m>.
    We call this quantity <term>determinant of <m>A</m></term>,
    <m>\det(A)</m>.
    We will see that the determinant of a general
    <m>n\times n</m> matrix will be essential in determining invertibility of the matrix.
