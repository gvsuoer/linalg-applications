  <title>The Distance Between Vectors</title>
  <p>
    Finding optimal solutions to systems is an important problem in applied mathematics.
    It is often the case that we cannot find an exact solution that satisfies certain constraints,
    so we look instead for the
    <q>best</q>
    solution that satisfies the constraints.
    An example of this is fitting a least squares line to a set of data.
    As we will see, the dot product will allow us to find
    <q>best</q>
    solutions to certain types of problems,
    where we measure accuracy using the notion of a distance between vectors.
    Geometrically,
    we can represent a vector <m>\vu</m> as a directed line segment from the origin to the point defined by <m>\vu</m>.
    If we have two vectors <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m>,
    we can think of the length of the difference
    <m>\vu - \vv</m> as a measure of how far apart the two vectors are from each other.
    It is natural,
    then to define the distance between vectors as follows.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> be vectors in <m>\R^n</m>.
        The <term>distance</term> between <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> is the length of the difference <m>\vu - \vv</m> or
        <me>
          || \vu - \vv ||
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    As <xref ref="F_6_a_vector_difference"></xref> illustrates,
    if vectors <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> emanate from the same initial point,
    and <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are the terminal points of <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m>,
    respectively,
    then the difference <m>|| \vu - \vv||</m> is the standard Euclidean distance between the points <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>.
