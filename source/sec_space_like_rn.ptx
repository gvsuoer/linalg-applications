  <title>Spaces with Similar Structure to <m>\R^n</m></title>
  <p>
    Mathematicians look for patterns and for similarities between mathematical objects.
    In doing so,
    mathematicians often consider larger collections of objects that are sorted according to their similarities and then study these collections rather than just the objects themselves.
    This perspective can be very powerful <mdash/> whatever can be shown to be true about an arbitrary element in a collection will then be true for every specific element in the collection.
    In this section we study the larger collection of sets that share the algebraic structure of vectors in <m>\R^n</m>.
    These sets are called <em>vector spaces</em>.

    In Preview <xref ref="pa_5_a">Activity</xref>,
    we showed that the set <m>\pol_1</m> of polynomials of degree less than or equal to one with real coefficients,
    with the operations of addition and scalar multiplication defined by
    <me>
      (a_0+a_1t)+(b_0+b_1t) = (a_0+b_0) + (a_1+b_1)t \ \ \ \text{ and }  \ \ \ k(a_0+a_1t) = (ka_0) + (ka_1)t
    </me>,
    has a structure similar to <m>\R^2</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    By structure we mean how the elements in the set relate to each other under addition and multiplication by scalars.
    That is, if <m>a(t)=a_0+a_1t</m>, <m>b(t)</m>,
    and <m>c(t)</m> are elements of <m>\pol_1</m> and <m>k</m> and <m>m</m> are scalars, then
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>a(t) + b(t)</m> is an element of <m>\pol_1</m>,
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>a(t)+b(t) = b(t) + a(t)</m>,
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>(a(t)+b(t)) + c(t) = a(t) + (b(t)+c(t))</m>,
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          there is a zero polynomial <m>z(t)</m> (namely,
          <m>0+0t</m>) in <m>\pol_1</m> so that <m>a(t) + z(t) = a(t)</m>,
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          there is an element <m>-a(t)</m> in <m>\pol_1</m> (namely,
          <m>(-a_0)+(-a_1)t</m>) so that <m>a(t) + (-a(t)) = z(t)</m>,
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>k a(t)</m> is an element of <m>\pol_1</m>,
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>(k+m) a(t) = ka(t) + ma(t)</m>,
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>k(a(t)+b(t)) = ka(t) + kb(t)</m>,
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>(km) a(t) = k(m a(t))</m>,
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>1 a(t) = a(t)</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    The properties we saw for polynomials in <m>\pol_1</m> stated above are the same as the properties for vector addition and multiplication by scalars in <m>\R^n</m>,
    as well as matrix addition and multiplication by scalars identified in <xref ref="sec_matrix_operations">Section</xref>.
    This indicates that polynomials in <m>\pol_1</m>, vectors in <m>\R^n</m>,
    and the set of <m>m \times n</m> matrices behave in much the same way as regards their addition and multiplication by scalars.
    There is an even closer connection between linear polynomials and vectors in <m>\R^2</m>.
    An element <m>a(t) = a_0 + a_1t</m> in <m>\pol_1</m> can be naturally associated with the vector <m>\left[ \begin{array}{c} a_0 \\ a_1 \end{array}  \right]</m> in <m>\R^2</m>.
    All the results of polynomial addition and multiplication by scalars then translate to corresponding results of addition and multiplication by scalars of vectors in <m>\R^2</m>.
    So for all intents and purposes,
    as far as addition and multiplication by scalars is concerned,
    there is no difference between elements in <m>\pol_1</m> and vectors in <m>\R^2</m> <mdash/> the only difference is how we choose to present the elements
    (as polynomials or as vectors).
    This sameness of structure of our sets as it relates to addition and multiplication by scalars is the type of similarity mentioned in the introduction.
    We can study all of the types of objects that exhibit this same structure at one time by studying vector spaces.
