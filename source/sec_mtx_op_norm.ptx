  <title>The Operator Norm of a Matrix</title>
  <p>
    Before we introduce the Singular Value Decomposition,
    let us work through some preliminaries to motivate the idea.
    The first is to provide an answer to the question
    <q>How <sq>big</sq> is a matrix?</q>
    There are many ways to interpret and answer this question,
    but a substantial
    (and useful)
    answer should involve more than just the dimensions of the matrix.
    A good measure of the size of a matrix,
    which we will refer to as the norm of the matrix,
    should take into account the action of the linear transformation defined by the matrix on vectors.
    This then will lead to questions about how difficult or easy is it to solve a matrix equation <m>A \vx = \vb</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we want to incorporate the action of a matrix <m>A</m> into a calculation of the norm of <m>A</m>,
    we might think of measuring how much <m>A</m> can change a vector <m>\vx</m>.
    This could lead us to using
    <m>||A\vx||</m> as some sort of measure of a norm of <m>A</m>.
    However, since <m>||A (c\vx)|| = |c| \ ||A\vx||</m> for any scalar <m>c</m>,
    scaling <m>\vx</m> by a large scalar will produce a large norm,
    so this is not a viable definition of a norm.
    We could instead measure the <term>relative</term>
    effect that <m>A</m> has on a vector <m>\vx</m> as <m>\ds \frac{||A\vx||}{||\vx||}</m>,
    since this ratio does not change when <m>\vx</m> is multiplied by a scalar.
    The largest of all of these ratios would provide a good sense of how much <m>A</m> can change vectors.
    Thus, we define the operator norm of a matrix <m>A</m> as follows.
  </p>

  <definition>
  <idx><h>operator norm of a matrix</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The <term>operator norm</term>
        <fn>
        Technically this definition should be in terms of a supremum,
        but because the equivalent definition restricts the <m>\vx</m>'s to a compact subset,
        the sup is achieved and we can use max.
        </fn> of a matrix <m>A</m> is
        <me>
          ||A|| = \max_{||\vx|| \neq 0} \left\{\frac{||A\vx||}{||\vx||} \right\}
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    Due to the linearity of matrix multiplication,
    we can restrict ourselves to unit vectors for an equivalent definition of the operator norm of the matrix <m>A</m> as
    <me>
      ||A|| = \ds \max_{||\vx|| = 1}\{||A\vx||\}
    </me>.

  <p>
    The operator norm of a matrix tells us that how big the action of an
    <m>m \times n</m> matrix is can be determined by its action on the unit sphere in <m>\R^n</m>
    (the unit sphere is the set of terminal point of unit vectors).
    Let us consider two examples.
  </p>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 2\amp 1 \\ 2\amp 5 \end{array} \right]</m>.
        We can draw a graph to see the action of <m>A</m> on the unit circle.
        A picture of the set <m>\{A\vx \ : \ ||\vx|| = 1\}</m> is shown in <xref ref="F_7_c_Mat_norm1"></xref>.
      </p>

      <figure xml:id="F_7_c_Mat_norm1">
        <caption>The image of the unit circle under the action of <m>A</m>.</caption>
        <image width="30%" source="7_c_Mat_norm_a"/>
      </figure>

      <p>
        It appears that <m>A</m> transforms the unit circle into an ellipse.
        To find <m>||A||</m> we want to maximize
        <m>||A\vx||</m> for <m>\vx</m> on the unit circle.
        This is the same as maximizing
        <me>
          ||A\vx||^2 = (A\vx)^{\tr}(A\vx) = \vx^{\tr}A^{\tr}A\vx
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now <m>A^{\tr}A = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 8\amp 12 \\ 12\amp 26 \end{array}  \right]</m> is a symmetric matrix,
        so we can orthogonally diagonalize <m>A^{\tr}A</m>.
        The eigenvalues of <m>A^{\tr}A</m> are 32 and 2.
        Let <m>P = [\vu_1 \ \vu_2]</m>,
        where <m>\vu_1=\left[ \frac{\sqrt{5}}{5} \ \frac{2\sqrt{5}}{5} \right]^{\tr}</m> is a unit eigenvector of
        <m>A^{\tr}A</m> with eigenvalue 32 and
        <m>\vu_2=\left[ -\frac{2\sqrt{5}}{5} \ \frac{\sqrt{5}}{5} \right]^{\tr}</m> is a unit eigenvector of <m>A^{\tr}A</m> with eigenvalue 2.
        Then <m>P</m> is an orthogonal matrix such that <m>P^{\tr}(A^{\tr}A)P = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 32\amp 0 \\ 0\amp 2 \end{array}  \right] = D</m>.
        It follows that
        <me>
          \vx^{\tr} (A^{\tr}A)  \vx = \vx^{\tr} PDP^{\tr} \vx = (P^{\tr}\vx)^{\tr} D (P^{\tr}\vx)
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now <m>P^{\tr}</m> is orthogonal,
        so <m>||P^{\tr}\vx|| = ||\vx||</m> and <m>P^{\tr}</m> maps the unit circle to the unit circle.
        Moreover, if <m>\vx</m> is on the unit circle,
        then <m>\vy = P\vx</m> is also on the unit circle and <m>P^{\tr}\vy = P^{\tr}P\vx = \vx</m>.
        So every point <m>\vx</m> on the unit circle corresponds to a point <m>P\vx</m> on the unit circle.
        Thus, the forms <m>\vx^{\tr} (A^{\tr}A) \vx</m> and
        <m>(P^{\tr}\vx)^{\tr} D (P^{\tr}\vx)</m> take on exactly the same values over all points on the unit circle.
        Now we just need to find the maximum value of <m>(P^{\tr}\vx)^{\tr} D (P^{\tr}\vx)</m>.
        This turns out to be relatively easy since <m>D</m> is a diagonal matrix.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's simplify the notation.
        Let <m>\vy = P^{\tr}\vx</m>.
        Then our job is to maximize <m>\vy^{\tr}D\vy</m>.
        If <m>\vy = [y_1 \ y_2]^{\tr}</m>, then
        <me>
          \vy^{\tr} D  \vy = 32y_1^2 + 2y_2^2
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We want to find the maximum value of this expression for <m>\vy</m> on the unit circle.
        Note that <m>2y_2^2 \leq 32y_2^2</m> and so
        <me>
          32y_1^2 + 2y_2^2 \leq 32y_1^2 + 32y_2^2 = 32(y_1^2+y_2^2) = 32||\vy||^2 = 32
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>[1 \ 0]^{\tr}</m> is on the unit circle,
        the expression <m>32y_1^2 + 2y_2^2</m> attains the value 32 at some point on the unit circle,
        so 32 is the maximum value of
        <m>\vy^{\tr} D \vy</m> over all <m>\vy</m> on the unit circle.
        While we are at it, we can similarly find the minimum value of
        <m>\vy^{\tr} D  \vy</m> for <m>\vy</m> on the unit circle.
        Since <m>2y_1^2 \leq 32y_1^2</m> we see that
        <me>
          32y_1^2 + 2y_2^2 \geq 2y_1^2 + 2y_2^2 = 2(y_1^2+y_2^2) = 2||\vy||^2 = 2
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the expression <m>\vy^{\tr} D \vy</m> attains the value 2 at <m>[0 \ 1]^{\tr}</m> on the unit circle,
        we can see that <m>\vy^{\tr} D \vy</m> attains the minimum value of 2 on the unit circle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now we can return to the expression <m>\vx^{\tr} (A^{\tr}A) \vx</m>.
        Since <m>\vy^{\tr} D \vy</m> assumes the same values as <m>\vx^{\tr} (A^{\tr}A) \vx</m>,
        we can say that the maximum value of
        <m>\vx^{\tr} (A^{\tr}A) \vx</m> for <m>\vx</m> on the unit circle is 32
        (and the minimum value is 2).
        Moreover, the quadratic form
        <m>(P^{\tr}\vx)^{\tr} D (P^{\tr}\vx)</m> assumes its maximum value when
        <m>P^{\tr}\vx = [1 \ 0]^{\tr}</m> or <m>[-1 \ 0]^{\tr}</m>.
        Thus, the form <m>\vx^{\tr} (A^{\tr}A) \vx</m> assumes its maximum value at the vector <m>\vx = P[1 \ 0 ]^{\tr} = \vu_1</m> or <m>-\vu_1</m>.
        Similarly, the quadratic form
        <m>\vx^{\tr} (A^{\tr}A) \vx</m> attains its minimum value at <m>P[0 \ 1]^{\tr} = \vu_2</m> or <m>-\vu_2</m>.
        We conclude that <m>||A|| = \sqrt{32}</m>.

  <title>IMPORTANTE NOTE 1</title>
  <p>
    What we have just argued is that the maximum value of
    <m>||A\vx||</m> for <m>\vx</m> on the unit sphere in <m>\R^n</m> is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of
    <m>A^{\tr}A</m> and occurs at a corresponding unit eigenvector.
  </p>
  </paragraphs>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        This same process works for matrices other than <m>2 \times 2</m> ones.
        For example,
        consider <m>A = \left[ \begin{array}{rrr} -2\amp 8\amp 20 \\ 14\amp 19\amp 10 \end{array} \right]</m>.
        In this case <m>A</m> maps <m>\R^3</m> to <m>\R^2</m>.
        The image of the unit sphere
        <m>\{\vx \in \R^3 : ||\vx|| = 1\}</m> under left multiplication by <m>A</m> is a filled ellipse as shown in <xref ref="F_7_c_Mat_norm_2"></xref>.
      </p>

      <figure xml:id="F_7_c_Mat_norm_2">
        <caption>The image of the unit circle under the action of <m>A</m>, and the vectors <m>A\vu_1</m> and <m>A\vu_2</m></caption>
        <image width="30%" source="7_c_Mat_norm_2"/>
      </figure>

      <p>
        As with the previous example,
        the norm of <m>A</m> is the square root of the maximum value of
        <m>\vx^{\tr} (A^{\tr}A) \vx</m> and this maximum value is the dominant eigenvalue of <m>A^{\tr}A = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} 200\amp 250\amp 100\\ 250\amp 425\amp 350\\ 100\amp 350\amp 500 \end{array} \right]</m>.
        The eigenvalues of <m>A</m> are
        <m>\lambda_1 = 900</m>, <m>\lambda_2 = 225</m>,
        and <m>\lambda_3 = 0</m> with corresponding unit eigenvectors <m>\vu_1=\left[ \frac{1}{3} \ \frac{2}{3} \ \frac{2}{3} \right]^{\tr}</m>,
        <m>\vu_1=\left[ -\frac{2}{3} \ -\frac{1}{3} \ \frac{2}{3} \right]^{\tr}</m>,
        and <m>\vu_3=\left[ \frac{2}{3} \ -\frac{2}{3} \ \frac{1}{3} \right]^{\tr}</m>.
        So in this case we have <m>||A|| = \sqrt{900} = 30</m>.
        The transformation defined by matrix multiplication by <m>A</m> from <m>\R^3</m> to <m>\R^2</m> has a one-dimensional kernel which is spanned by the eigenvector corresponding to <m>\lambda_3</m>.
        The image of the transformation is 2-dimensional and the image of the unit circle is an ellipse where <m>A\vu_1</m> gives the major axis of the ellipse and <m>A\vu_2</m> gives the minor axis.
        Essentially, the square roots of the eigenvalues of
        <m>A^{\tr}A</m> tell us how <m>A</m> stretches the image space in each direction.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <paragraphs>
  <title>IMPORTANT NOTE 2</title>
  <p>
    We have just argued that the image of the unit <m>n</m>-sphere under the action of an
    <m>m \times n</m> matrix is an ellipsoid in <m>\R^m</m> stretched the greatest amount,
    <m>\sqrt{\lambda_1}</m>,
    in the direction of an eigenvector for the largest eigenvalue (<m>\lambda_1</m>) of <m>A^{\tr}A</m>;
    the next greatest amount, <m>\sqrt{\lambda_2}</m>,
    in the direction of a unit vector for the second largest eigenvalue (<m>\lambda_2</m>) of <m>A^{\tr}A</m>;
    and so on.
