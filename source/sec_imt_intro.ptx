  <title>Introduction</title>

    This section is different than others in this book in that it contains only one long proof of the equivalence of statements that we have already discussed.
    As such, this is a theoretical section and there is no application connected to it.

    The Invertible Matrix Theorem is a theorem that provides many different statements that are equivalent to having a matrix be invertible.
    To understand the Invertible Matrix Theorem,
    we need to know what it means for two statements to be <em>equivalent</em>.
        <idx><h>equivalent statements</h></idx>
    By equivalent,
    we mean that if one of the statements is true, then so is the other.
    We examine this idea in this preview activity.

      Let <m>A</m> be an <m>n \times n</m> matrix.
      In this activity we endeavor to understand why the two statements
      <ul>
        <li>
          <title>I</title>
          <p>
            The matrix <m>A</m> is invertible.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The matrix <m>A^{\tr}</m> is invertible.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      are equivalent.
      To demonstrate that statements I and II are equivalent,
      we need to argue that if statement I is true,
      then so is statement II, and if statement II is true then so is statement I.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Let's first show that if statement I is true,
            then so is statement II. So we assume statement I. That is,
            we assume that <m>A</m> is an invertible matrix.
            So we know that there is an
            <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>B</m> such that <m>AB = BA = I_n</m>,
            where <m>I_n</m> is the <m>n \times n</m> identity matrix.
            To demonstrate that statement II must also be true,
            we need to verify that <m>A^{\tr}</m> is an invertible matrix.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  What is <m>I_n^{\tr}</m>?
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Take the transpose of both sides of the equation
                  <m>AB = I_n</m> and use the properties of the transpose to write
                  <m>(AB)^{\tr}</m> in terms of <m>A^{\tr}</m> and <m>B^{\tr}</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Take the transpose of both sides of the equation
                  <m>BA = I_n</m> and use the properties of the transpose to write
                  <m>(BA)^{\tr}</m> in terms of <m>A^{\tr}</m> and <m>B^{\tr}</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Explain how the previous two parts show that <m>B^{\tr}</m> is the inverse of <m>A^{\tr}</m>,
                  so that <m>A^{\tr}</m> is invertible.
                  So we have shown that if statement I is true, so is statement II.<fn>
                  Note that statement I does not have to be true.
                  We are only assuming that IF statement I is true,
                  then statement II must also be true.
                  </fn>
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Now we prove that if statement II is true,
            then so is statement I. So we assume statement II. That is,
            we assume that the matrix <m>A^{\tr}</m> is invertible.
            We could do this in the same manner as part (a),
            or we could be a bit clever.
            Let's try to be clever.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  What matrix is <m>\left(A^{\tr}\right)^{\tr}</m>?
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Why can we use the result of part (a) with <m>A^{\tr}</m> in place of <m>A</m> to conclude that <m>A</m> is invertible?
                  As a consequence,
                  we have demonstrated that <m>A</m> is invertible if <m>A^{\tr}</m> is invertible.
                  This concludes our argument that statements I and II are equivalent.
