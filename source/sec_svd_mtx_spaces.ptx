  <title>SVD and the Null, Column, and Row Spaces of a Matrix</title>
  <p>
    We conclude this section with a short discussion of how a singular value decomposition relates fundamental subspaces of a matrix.
    We have seen that the vectors <m>\vu_1</m>,
    <m>\vu_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
    <m>\vu_r</m> in an SVD for an
    <m>m \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> form a basis for <m>\Col A</m>.
    Recall also that <m>A \vv_j = \vzero</m> for <m>r+1 \leq j \leq n</m>.
    Since <m>\dim(\Nul A) + \dim(\Col A) = n</m>,
    it follows that the vectors <m>\vv_{r+1}</m>, <m>\vv_{r+2}</m>,
    <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\vv_n</m> form a basis for <m>\Nul A</m>.
    As you will show in the exercises,
    the set <m>\{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_r\}</m> is a basis for <m>\Row A</m>.
    Thus, an SVD for a matrix <m>A</m> tells us about three fundamental vector spaces related to <m>A</m>.
