  <title>Application: B&#xe9;zier Curves</title>
  <p>
    B&#xe9;zier curves are simple curves that were first developed in 1959 by French mathematician Paul de Casteljau,
    who was working at the French automaker Citro&#xeb;n.
    The curves were made public in 1962 by Pierre B&#xe9;zier who used them in his work designing automobiles at the French car maker Renault.
    In addition to automobile design, B&#xe9;zier curves have many other uses.
    Two of the most common applications of B&#xe9;zier curves are font design and drawing tools.
    As an example, the letter
    <q>S</q>
    in Palatino font is shown using B&#xe9;zier curves in <xref ref="F_Letter_S"></xref>.
    If you've used Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Macromedia Freehand, Fontographer,
    or any other of a number of drawing programs,
    then you've used B&#xe9;zier curves.
    At the end of this section we will see how B&#xe9;zier curves can be defined using linearly independent vectors and linear combinations of vectors.
