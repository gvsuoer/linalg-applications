  <p>
    So far we have worked with real matrices whose eigenvalues are all real.
    However, the characteristic polynomial of a matrix with real entries can have complex roots.
    In this section we investigate the properties of these complex roots and their corresponding eigenvectors,
    how these complex eigenvectors are found,
    and the geometric interpretation of the transformations defined by matrices with complex eigenvalues.
    Although we can consider matrices that have complex numbers as entries,
    we will restrict ourselves to matrices with real entries.

            Find the eigenvalues of <m>A</m>.
            You should get two complex numbers.
            How are these complex numbers related?
