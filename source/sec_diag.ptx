    we saw how if we can powers of a matrix we can make predictions about the long-term behavior of some systems.
    In general, calculating powers of a matrix can be a very difficult thing,
    but there are times when the process is straightforward.

    illustrates that calculating powers of square matrices whose only nonzero entries are along the diagonal is rather simple.
    In general, if
    <me>
      D = \left[ \begin{array}{cccccc} d_{11}   \amp 0       \amp 0        \amp \cdots      \amp 0    \amp 0 \\ 0       \amp  d_{22}   \amp 0        \amp \cdots      \amp 0    \amp 0 \\ \vdots  \amp  0          \amp 0        \amp \ddots      \amp       \amp \vdots \\ 0       \amp  0       \amp 0          \amp  \cdots    \amp 0    \amp d_{nn} \end{array}  \right]
    </me>,
    then
    <me>
      D^k = \left[ \begin{array}{cccccc} d_{11}^k   \amp 0       \amp 0        \amp \cdots      \amp 0    \amp 0 \\ 0       \amp  d_{22}^k   \amp 0        \amp \cdots      \amp 0    \amp 0 \\ \vdots  \amp  0            \amp 0        \amp \ddots      \amp       \amp \vdots \\ 0       \amp  0         \amp 0          \amp  \cdots    \amp 0    \amp d_{nn}^k \end{array}  \right]
    </me>
    for any positive integer <m>k</m>.
    Recall that a diagonal matrix is a matrix whose only nonzero elements are along the diagonal
    (see <xref ref="def_special_matrices">Definition</xref>).
    In this section we will see that matrices that are similar to diagonal matrices have some very nice properties,
    and that diagonal matrices are useful in calculations of powers of matrices.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can utilize the method of calculating powers of diagonal matrices to also easily calculate powers of other types of matrices.

    As <xref ref="act_4_c_0_5"></xref> illustrates,
    to calculate the powers of a matrix of the form
    <m>P^{-1}DP</m> we only need determine the powers of the matrix <m>D</m>.
    If <m>D</m> is a diagonal matrix,
    this is especially straightforward.
