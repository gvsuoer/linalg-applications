  <p>
    We have previously seen that <m>\R^n</m> and the set of fixed size matrices have a nice algebraic structure when endowed with the addition and scalar multiplication operations.
    In fact, as we will see,
    there are many other sets of elements that have the same kind of structure with natural addition and scalar multiplication operations.
    Due to this underlying similar structure,
    these sets are connected in some way and can all be studied jointly.
    Mathematicians look for these kinds of connections between seemingly dissimilar objects and,
    from a mathematical standpoint,
    it is convenient to study all of these similar structures at once by combining them into a larger collection.
    This motivates the idea of a <em>vector space</em>
    that we will investigate in this chapter.
  </p>
  <p>
    An example of a set that has a structure similar to vectors is a collection of polynomials.
    Let <m>\pol_1</m> be the collection of all polynomials of degree less than or equal to 1 with real coefficients.
    That is,
    <me>
      \pol_1 = \{ a_0 + a_1t : a_0, a_1 \in \R\}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, for example, the polynomials <m>2+t</m>, <m>5t</m>,
    <m>-7</m>,
    and <m>\sqrt{12}-\pi t</m> are in <m>\pol_1</m>,
    but <m>\sqrt{t}</m> is not in <m>\pol_1</m>.
    Two polynomials <m>a(t)=a_0+a_1t</m> and
    <m>b(t)=b_0+b_1t</m> in <m>\pol_1</m> are equal if <m>a_0=b_0</m> and <m>a_1=b_1</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We define addition of polynomials in <m>\pol_1</m> by adding the coefficients of the like degree terms.
    So if <m>a(t) = a_0+a_1t</m> and <m>b(t) = b_0+b_1t</m>,
    then the polynomial sum of <m>a(t)</m> and <m>b(t)</m> is
    <me>
      a(t)+b(t) = (a_0+a_1t) + (b_0+b_1t) = (a_0+b_0) + (a_1+b_1)t
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, for example,
    <me>
      (2+3t)+(-1+5t) = (2+(-1)) + (3+5)t = 1+8 t
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We now consider the properties of the addition operation.
    For example, we can ask if polynomial addition is commutative.
    That is, if <m>a(t)</m> and <m>b(t)</m> are in <m>\pol_1</m>,
    must it be the case that
    <me>
      a(t)+b(t)~=~b(t)+a(t)?
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    To show that addition is commutative in <m>\pol_1</m>,
    we choose arbitrary polynomials
    <m>a(t) = a_0 + a_1t</m> and <m>b(t) = b_0 + b_1t</m> in <m>\pol_1</m>.
    Then we have
    <md>
      <mrow>a(t)+b(t) \amp = (a_0+b_0) + (a_1+b_1)t</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp = (b_0+a_0) + (b_1+a_1)t</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp = b(t)+a(t)</mrow>
    </md>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that in the middle step,
    we used the definition of equality of polynomials since <m>a_0+b_0=b_0+a_0</m> and
    <m>a_1+b_1=b_1+a_1</m> due to the fact that addition of real numbers is commutative.
    So addition of elements in <m>\pol_1</m> is a commutative operation.

            Now we investigate other properties of addition in <m>\pol_1</m>.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  To show addition is associative in <m>\pol_1</m>,
                  we need to verify that if <m>a(t) = a_0 + a_1t</m>, <m>b(t) = b_0+b_1t</m>,
                  and <m>c(t) = c_0 + c_1t</m> are in <m>\pol_1</m>, it must be the case that
                  <me>
                    (a(t) + b(t)) + c(t) = a(t) + (b(t)+c(t))
                  </me>.
                  Either verify this property by using the definition of two polynomials being equal,
                  or give a counterexample to show the equality fails in that case.
                </p>

              <li>
                <p>
                  Find a polynomial <m>z(t) \in \pol_1</m> such that
                  <me>
                    a(t) + z(t) = a(t)
                  </me>
                  for all <m>a(t) \in \pol_1</m>.
                  This polynomial is called the <em>zero</em>
                  polynomial or the <em>additive identity</em>
                  polynomial in <m>\pol_1</m>.

                  </me>,
                  where <m>z(t)</m> is the additive identity polynomial you found above?
                  If not, why not?
                  If so, what polynomial is <m>p(t)</m>?
                  Explain.

            We can also define a multiplication of polynomials by scalars
            (real numbers).

                  What element in <m>\pol_1</m> could be the scalar multiple <m>\frac{1}{2} (2+3t)</m>?

              <li>
                <p>
                  In general, if <m>k</m> is a scalar and <m>a(t) = a_0 + a_1t</m> is in <m>\pol_1</m>,
                  how do we define the scalar multiple <m>ka(t)</m> in <m>\pol_1</m>?
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If <m>k</m> is a scalar and <m>a(t) = a_0 + a_1t</m> and
                  <m>b(t) = b_0 + b_1t</m> are elements in <m>\pol_1</m>,
                  is it true that
                  <me>
                    k(a(t) + b(t)) = ka(t) + kb(t)?

                  If no, explain why.
                  If yes, verify your answer using the definition of two polynomials being equal.
