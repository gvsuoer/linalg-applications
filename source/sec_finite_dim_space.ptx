    shows that if sets <m>\CB_1</m> and <m>\CB_2</m> are finite bases for a vector space <m>V</m>,
    which are linearly independent by definition,
    then each cannot contain more elements than the other,
    so the number of elements in each basis must be equal.

        If a non-trivial vector space <m>V</m> has a basis of <m>n</m> vectors,
        then every basis of <m>V</m> contains exactly <m>n</m> vectors.

    <xref ref="thm_5_c_2">Theorem</xref>
    states that if a vector space <m>V</m> has a basis with a finite number of vectors,
    then the number of vectors in a basis for that vector space is a well-defined number.
    In other words, the number of vectors in a basis is an
    <em>invariant</em> of the vector space.
    This important number is given a name.

        A <term>finite-dimensional</term><idx><h>vector space</h><h>finite dimensional</h></idx> vector space is a vector space that can be spanned by a finite number of vectors.
        The <term>dimension</term><idx><h>vector space</h><h>dimension</h></idx> of a non-trivial finite-dimensional vector space is the number of vectors in a basis for <m>V</m>.
        The dimension of the trivial vector space is defined to be 0.

    We denote the dimension of a finite dimensional vector space <m>V</m> by <m>\dim(V)</m>.

    Not every vector space is finite dimensional.
    We have seen, for example,
    that the vector space <m>\pol</m> of all polynomials,
    regardless of degree, is not a finite-dimensional vector space.
    In fact, the polynomials
    <me>
      1, t, t^2, \ldots, t^n, \ldots
    </me>
    are linearly independent,
    so <m>\pol</m> has an infinite linearly independent set and therefore has no finite basis.
    A vector space that has an infinite basis is called an
    <em>infinite dimensional</em> vector space.

      Since columns of the <m>n \times n</m> identity matrix span <m>\R^n</m> and are linearly independent,
      the columns of <m>I_n</m> form a basis for <m>\R^n</m>
      (the standard basis).
      Consequently, we have that <m>\dim(\R^n) = n</m>.
      In this activity we determine the dimensions of other familiar vector spaces.
      Find the dimensions of each of the indicated vector spaces.

    Finding the dimension of a finite-dimensional vector space amounts to finding a basis for the space.
