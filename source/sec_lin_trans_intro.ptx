  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>
    We have encountered functions throughout our study of mathematics <mdash/> we explore graphs of functions in algebra and differentiate and integrate functions in calculus.
    In linear algebra we have investigated special types of functions,
    e.g., matrix and coordinate transformations,
    that preserve the vector space structure.
    Any function that has the same properties as matrix and coordinate transformations is a
    <term>linear transformation</term>.
    Linear transformations are important in linear algebra in that we can study similarities and connections between vector spaces by examining transformations between them.
    Linear transformations model or approximately model certain real-life processes
    (like discrete dynamical systems,
    geometrical transformations, Google PageRank, etc.).
    Also, we can determine the behavior of an entire linear transformation by knowing how it acts on just a basis.

    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>linear transformation</term>
        from a vector space <m>V</m> to a vector space <m>W</m> is a function <m>T: V \to W</m> such that
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>T(\vu + \vv) = T(\vu) + T(\vv)</m> and
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>T(c\vv) = cT(\vv)</m>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        for all <m>\vu, \vv</m> in <m>V</m> and all scalars <m>c</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    These transformations are called <term>linear</term>
    because they respect linear combinations.
    We can combine both parts of this definition into one statement and say that a mapping <m>T</m> from a vector space <m>V</m> to a vector space <m>W</m> is a linear transformation if
    <me>
      T(a\vu + b \vv) = aT(\vu) + bT(\vv)
    </me>
    for all vectors <m>\vu, \vv</m> in <m>V</m> and all scalars <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
    We can extend this property of a linear transformation
    (by mathematical induction)
    to any finite linear combination of vectors.
    That is, if <m>\vv_1</m>, <m>\vv_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
    <m>\vv_k</m> are any vectors in the domain of a linear transformation <m>T</m> and <m>c_1</m>,
    <m>c_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>c_k</m> are any scalars, then
    <me>
      T(c_1 \vv_1 + c_2 \vv_2 + \cdots + c_k \vv_k) = c_1 T(\vv_1) + c_2 T(\vv_2) + \cdots + c_k T(\vv_k)
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is the property that <m>T</m> respects linear combinations.

            Let <m>\D</m> be the set of all differentiable functions from <m>\R</m> to <m>\R</m>.
            Since <m>\frac{d}{dx}(0) = 0</m>,

            Every matrix transformation is a linear transformation,
            so we might expect that general linear transformations share some of the properties of matrix transformations.
            Let <m>T</m> be a linear transformation from a vector space <m>V</m> to a vector space <m>W</m>.
            Use the linearity properties to show that <m>T(\vzero_V) = \vzero_W</m>,
            where <m>\vzero_V</m> is the additive identity in <m>V</m> and
            <m>\vzero_W</m> is the additive identity in <m>W</m>.
