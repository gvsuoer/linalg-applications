    If <m>V</m> is a vector space with a basis <m>\CB = \{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_n\}</m>,
    we have seen that the coordinate transformation <m>T : V \to \R^n</m> defined by
    <m>T(\vx) = [\vx]_{\CB}</m> is a linear transformation that is both one-to-one and onto.
    This allows us to uniquely identify any vector in <m>V</m> with a vector in <m>\R^n</m> so that the vector space structure is preserved.
    In other words,
    the vector space <m>V</m> is for all intents and purposes the same as the vector space <m>\R^n</m>,
    except for the way we represent the vectors.
    This is a very powerful idea in that it shows that any vector space of dimension <m>n</m> is essentially the same as <m>\R^n</m>.
    When this happens we say that the vectors spaces are <em>isomorphic</em>
    and call the coordinate transformation an <em>isomorphism</em>.

        from a vector space <m>V</m> to a vector space <m>W</m> is a linear transformation
        <m>T : V \to W</m> that is one-to-one and onto.

    We this terminology,
    we summarize the discussion in the following theorem.

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>V</m> is a vector space of dimension <m>n</m>,
        then any coordinate transformation from <m>V</m> to <m>\R^n</m> is an isomorphism.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

    It is left for the exercises to show that if <m>T: V \to W</m> is an isomorphism,
    then <m>T^{-1}: W \to V</m> is also an isomorphism.
    So if there is an isomorphism from a vector space <m>V</m> to a vector space <m>W</m>,
    then there is an isomorphism from <m>W</m> to <m>V</m>.
    As a result, we say that <m>V</m> and <m>W</m> are
    <em>isomorphic</em> vector spaces.
        <idx><h>vector spaces</h><h>isomorphic</h></idx>
    It is also true that any vector space is isomorphic to itself,
    and that if <m>V</m> is isomorphic to <m>W</m> and <m>W</m> is isomorphic to <m>U</m>,
    then <m>V</m> and <m>U</m> are also isomorphic.
    The proof of this result is left to the exercises.
    From this last property we can conclude that any two vector spaces of dimension <m>n</m> are isomorphic vector spaces.
    This validates statement we made earlier that the vector space <m>\pol_n</m> is for all intents and purposes the same as <m>\R^{n+1}</m>,
    since the two spaces are isomorphic.
    So to understand all finite dimensional vector spaces,
    it is enough to understand <m>\R^n</m>.
    The next activity provides a little practice with isomorphisms.

      Assume that each of the following maps is a linear transformation.
      Which, if any, is an isomorphism?
      Justify your reasoning.

          <p>
            <m>T: \pol_1 \to \R^2</m> defined by <m>T(a_0+a_1t) = \left[ \begin{array}{c} a_1\\a_1+a_0 \end{array} \right]</m>
