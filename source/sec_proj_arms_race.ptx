  <title>Project: The Richardson Arms Race Model</title>
  <p>
    How and why a nation arms itself for defense depends on many factors.
    Among these factors are the offensive military capabilities a nation deems its enemies have,
    the resources available for creating military forces and equipment,
    and many others.
    To begin to analyze such a situation,
    we will need some notation and background.
    In this section we will consider a two nation scenario,
    but the methods can be extended to any number of nations.
    In fact, after World War I, Richardson collected data and created a model for the countries Czechoslovakia, China, France, Germany, England, Italy, Japan, Poland,
    the USA, and the USSR.<fn>
    The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), headed by Russia,
    was a confederation of socialist republics in Eurasia.
    The USSR disbanded in 1991.
    Czechoslovakia was a sovereign state in central Europe that peacefully split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993.
    </fn>
  </p>
  <p>
    Let <m>N_1</m> and <m>N_2</m> represent <m>2</m> different nations.
    Each nation has some military capability
    (we will call this the <term>armament</term> of the nation)
    at time <m>n</m>
    (think of <m>n</m> as representing the year).
    Let <m>a_1(n)</m> represent the armament of nation <m>N_1</m> at time <m>n</m>,
    and <m>a_2(n)</m> the armament of nation <m>N_2</m> at time <m>n</m>.
    We could measure <m>a_i(n)</m> in weaponry or dollars or whatever units make sense for armaments.
    The Richardson arms race model provides connections between the armaments of the two nations.

  <project xml:id="act_arms_race_1">
    <introduction>
    <p>
      We continue to analyze a two nation scenario.
      Let us suppose that our two nations are Iran
      (nation <m>N_1</m>)
      and Iraq
      (nation <m>N_2</m>).
      In 1980, Iraq invaded Iran resulting in a long and brutal 8 year war.
      Richardson was interested in analyzing data to see if such wars could be predicted by the changes in armaments of each nation.
      We construct the two nation model in this activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      During each time period every nation adds or subtracts from its armaments.
      In our model,
      we will consider three main effects on the changes in armaments:
      the defense effect, fatigue effect and the grievance effect.
      In this activity we will discuss each effect in turn and then create a model to represent a two nation arms race.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            We first consider the defense effect.
            In a two nation scenario,
            each nation may react to the potential threat implied by an arms buildup of the other nation.
            For example,
            if nation <m>N_1</m> feels threatened by nation <m>N_2</m>
            (think of South and North Korea,
            or Ukraine and Russia, for example),
            then nation <m>N_2</m>'s level of armament might cause nation <m>N_1</m> to increase its armament in response.
            We will let <m>\delta_{12}</m> represent this effect of nation <m>N_2</m>'s armament on the armament of nation <m>N_1</m>.
            Nation <m>N_1</m> will then increase
            (or decrease)
            its armament in time period <m>n</m> by the amount
            <m>\delta_{12}a_2(n-1)</m> based on the armament of nation <m>N_2</m> in time period <m>n-1</m>.
            We will call <m>\delta_{12}</m> a
            <em>defense coefficient</em>.<fn>
            Of course, there are many other factors that have not been taken into account in the analysis.
            A nation may have heavily armed allies
            (like the U.S.)
            which may provide enough perceived security that this analysis is not relevant.
            Also, a nation might be a neutral state,
            such as Switzerland, and this analysis might not apply to such nations.
            </fn>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Next we discuss the fatigue effect.
            Keeping a strong defense is an expensive and taxing enterprise,
            often exacting a heavy toll on the resources of a nation.
            For example,
            consider the fatigue that the U.S. experienced fighting wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,
            losing much hardware and manpower in these conflicts.
            Let <m>\delta_{ii}</m> represent this
            <term>fatigue factor</term> on nation <m>i</m>.
            Think of <m>\delta_{ii}</m> as a measure of how much the nation has to replace each year,
            so a positive fatigue factor means that the nation is adding to its armament.
            The fatigue factor produces an effect of
            <m>\delta_{ii}a_i(n-1)</m> on the armament of nation <m>i</m> at time <m>t=n</m> that is the effect of the armament at time <m>t=n-1</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The last factor we consider is what we will call a grievance factor.
            This can be thought of as the set of ambitions and/or grievances against other nations
            (such as the acquisition or reacquisition of territory currently belonging to another country).
            As an example, Argentina and Great Britain both claim the Falkland Islands as territory.
            In 1982 Argentina invaded the disputed Falkland Islands which resulted in a two-month long undeclared Falkland Islands war,
            which returned control to the British.
            It seems reasonable that one nation might want to have sufficient armament in place to support its claim if force becomes necessary.
            Assuming that these grievances and ambitions have a constant impact on the armament of a nation from year to year,
            let <m>g_i</m> be this
            <q>grievance</q>
            constant for nation <m>i</m>.<fn>
            It might be possible for <m>g_i</m> to be negative if,
            for example,
            a nation feels that such disputes can and should only be settled by negotiation.
            </fn> The effect a grievance factor <m>g_i</m> would have on the armament of nation <m>i</m> in year <m>n</m> would be to add <m>g_i</m> directly to <m>a_i(n-1)</m>,
            since the factor <m>g_i</m> is constant from year to year
            (paying for arms and soldier's wages, for example)
            and does not depend on the amount of existing armament.

      In order to analyze a specific arms race between nations,

      <xref ref="T_Expenditures"></xref>
      shows the military expenditures of Iran and Iraq in the years leading up to their war in 1975. (The data is in millions of US dollars,
      adjusted for inflation and is taken from ``World Military Expenditures and Arms Transfers 1966-1975" by the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.) We can perform regression
      (we will see how in a later section)
      on this data to obtain the following linear approximations:

    <introduction>
    <p>
      The idea of an arms race, theoretically,
      is to reach a point at which all parties feel secure and no additional money needs to be spent on armament.
      If such a situation ever arises,
      then the armament of all nations is stable, or in equilibrium.
      If we have an equilibrium solution,
      then for large values of <m>n</m> we will have <m>\va_n = \va_{n-1}</m>.
      So to find an equilibrium solution,
      if it exists, we need to find a vector <m>\va_E</m> so that
      <men xml:id="eq_AR_equilibrium">
        \va_E = (D+I)\va_E + \vg
      </men>
      where <m>I</m> is the appropriate size identity matrix.
      If <m>\va_{E}</m> exists,
      we call <m>\va_E</m> an <term>equilibrium state</term>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can apply matrix algebra to find the equilibrium state vector <m>\va_E</m> under certain conditions.
    </p>
    </introduction>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Assuming that <m>\va_E</m> exists,
            use matrix algebra and <xref ref="eq_AR_equilibrium">Equation</xref> to show that
            <men xml:id="eq_AR_equilibrium_2">
              D\va_E + \vg = 0

            Explain.
            Under these conditions, how can we find this unique equilibrium state?
            Write this equilibrium state vector <m>\va_{E}</m> as a matrix-vector product.

            explain what the appropriate entry of the equilibrium state vector <m>\va_E</m> suggests about what Iran and Iraq's policies should be.
