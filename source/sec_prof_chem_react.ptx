  <title>Project: Modeling a Chemical Reaction</title>
  <p>
    Recall the chemical equation
    <me>
      \text{C} _2\text{H} _6 + \text{O} _2 \to \text{ CO } _2 + \text{H} _2\text{O}
    </me>
    from the beginning of this section.
    This equation illustrates the reaction between ethane (<m>\text{C} _2\text{H} _6</m>) and oxygen (<m>\text{O} _2</m>),called the <em>reactants</em>,
    to produce carbon dioxide (<m>\text{ CO } _2</m>) and water (<m>\text{H} _2\text{O}</m>),
    called the <em>products</em> of the reaction.
    In any chemical reaction,
    the total mass of the reactants must equal the total mass of the products.
    In our reaction the chemicals involved are made up of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O) atoms.
    To balance the equation,
    we need to know how many molecules of each chemical are combined to preserve the number of atoms of C, H, and O.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let <m>x_1</m> be the number of molecules of <m>\text{C} _2\text{H} _6</m>,
    <m>x_2</m> the number of molecules of <m>\text{O} _2</m>,
    <m>x_3</m> the number of molecules of <m>\text{ CO } _2</m>,
    and <m>x_4</m> the number of molecules of <m>\text{H} _2\text{O}</m> in the reaction.
    We can then represent this reaction as
    <me>
      x_1 \text{C} _2\text{H} _6 + x_2 \text{O} _2 \to x_3 \text{ CO } _2 + x_4 \text{H} _2\text{O}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In each molecule (e.g., ethane <m>\text{C} _2\text{H} _6</m>),
    the subscripts indicate the number of atoms of each element in the molecule.
    So 1 molecule of ethane contains 2 atoms of carbon and 6 atoms of hydrogen.
    Thus, there are 2 atoms of carbon in
    <m>\text{C} _2\text{H} _6</m> and 0 atoms of carbon in <m>\text{O} _2</m>,
    giving us <m>2x_1</m> carbon atoms in <m>x_1</m> molecules of
    <m>\text{C} _2\text{H} _6</m> and 0 carbon atoms in <m>x_2</m> molecules of <m>\text{O} _2</m>.
    On the product side of the reaction there is 1 carbon atom in
    <m>\text{ CO } _2</m> and 0 carbon atoms in <m>\text{H} _2\text{O}</m>.
    To balance the reaction,
    we know that the number of carbon atoms in the products must equal the number of carbon atoms in the reactants.

            Set up an equation that balances the number of carbon atoms on both sides of the reaction.

            Balance the numbers of hydrogen and oxygen atoms in the reaction to explain why

        </li>
        <li>

            So the system of linear equations that models this chemical reaction is
            <md>
              <mrow> {2}x_1   \amp {}    \amp {}    \amp {}-{}  \amp {}x_3  \amp {}    \amp {}       \amp {}={}  \amp  \ 0\amp {}</mrow>
              <mrow>{6}x_1  \amp {}     \amp {}     \amp {}    \amp {}    \amp {}-{}  \amp {2}x_4   \amp {}={}   \amp  \ 0\amp {}</mrow>
              <mrow>{}      \amp {}    \amp {2}x_2  \amp {}-{}   \amp {2}x_3  \amp {}-{}  \amp {}x_4    \amp {}={}   \amp  \ 0\amp {.}</mrow>
            </md>
            Find all solutions to this system and then balance the reaction.
            Note that we cannot have a fraction of a molecule in our reaction.

      Chemical reactions can be very interesting.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Carbon dioxide, <m>\text{ CO } _2</m>,
            is a familiar product of combustion.
            For example, when we burn glucose,
            <m>\text{C} _6\text{H} _{12}\text{O} _6</m>,
            the products of the reaction are carbon dioxide and water:
            <men xml:id="eq_reaction2">
              \text{C} _6\text{H} _{12}\text{O} _6 + \text{O} _2 \to \text{ CO } _2 + \text{H} _2\text{O}
            </men>.
            Use the techniques developed in this project to balance this reaction.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            To burn glucose,
            we need to add oxygen to make the combustion happen.
            Carbon dioxide is different in that it can burn without the presence of oxygen.
            For example,
            when we mix magnesium (Mg) with dry ice (<m>\text{ CO } _2</m>),
            the products are magnesium oxide (MgO) and carbon (C).
            This is an interesting reaction to watch:
            you can see it at many websites,
            e.g., \url{http://www.ebaumsworld.com/video/watch/404311/} or \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6dfi8LyRLA}.  Use the method determined above to balance the chemical reaction
            <men xml:id="eq_reaction3">
              \text{ Mg }  + \text{ CO } _2 \to \text{ MgO }  + \text{C}
            </men>.
