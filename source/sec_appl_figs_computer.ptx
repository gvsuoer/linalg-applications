  <title>Application: Hidden Figures in Computer Graphics</title>
  <p>
    In video games,
    the speed at which a computer can render changing graphics views is vitally important.
    To increase a computer's ability to render a scene,
    programs often try to identify those parts of the images a viewer could see and those parts the viewer could not see.
    For example, in a scene involving buildings,
    the viewer could not see any images blocked by a solid building.
    In the mathematical world, this can be visualized by graphing surfaces.
    In <xref ref="F_House"></xref>
    we see a crude image of a house made up of small polygons
    (this is how programs generally represent surfaces).
    On the left in <xref ref="F_House"></xref>
    we see all of the polygons that are needed to construct the entire surface,
    even those polygons that lie behind others which we could not see if the surface was solid.
    On the right in <xref ref="F_House"></xref>
    we have hidden the parts of the polygons that we cannot see from our view.
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="F_House">
    <caption>Images of a house.</caption>
    <image width="50%" source="6_a_House"/>
  </figure>
  <p>
    We also see this idea in mathematics when we graph surfaces.
    <xref ref="F_Surface"></xref>
    shows the graph of the surface defined by
    <m>f(x,y) = \sqrt{4-x^2}</m> that is made up of polygons.
    At left we see all of the polygons and at right only those parts that would be visible from our viewing perspective.
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="F_Surface">
    <caption>Graphs of <m>f(x,y) = \sqrt{4-x^2}</m>.</caption>
    <sidebyside width="30%">
    <image source="6_a_Surface_1"/>   
    <image source="6_a_Surface_2"/>
    </sidebyside>
  </figure>
  <p>
    By eliminating the parts of the polygons we cannot see from our viewing perspective,
    the computer program can more quickly render the viewing image.
    Later in this section we will explore one method for how programs remove the hidden portions of images.
    This process involves the dot product of vectors.
