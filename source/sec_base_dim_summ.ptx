  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>
    The key idea in this section is the
    <term>dimension</term> of a vector space.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Any two bases for a vector space <em>must</em>
          contain the same number of vectors.
          Therefore, we can define the <term>dimension</term>
          of a vector space <m>W</m> to be the number of vectors in any basis for <m>W</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If <m>W</m> is a subspace of <m>\R^n</m> with dimension <m>k</m> and <m>S</m> is any linearly independent subset of <m>W</m> with <m>k</m> vectors,
          then <m>S</m> is a basis for <m>W</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If <m>W</m> is a subspace of <m>\R^n</m> with dimension <m>k</m> and <m>S</m> is any subset of <m>W</m> with <m>k</m> vectors that spans <m>W</m>,
          then <m>S</m> is a basis for <m>W</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The rank of a matrix is the dimension of its column space.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The Rank-Nullity Theorem states that if <m>A</m> is an <m>m \times n</m> matrix,
          then <m>\rank(A) + \nullity(A) = n</m>.
