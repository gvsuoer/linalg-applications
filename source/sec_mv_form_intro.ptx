    There is another useful way to represent a system of linear equations using a matrix-vector product that we investigate in this section.
    To understand how this product comes about,
    recall that we can represent the linear system
    <md>
      <mrow> x_1     \amp {}+{}   \amp {4}x_2   \amp {}+{}  \amp {2}x_3   \amp {}+{}  \amp {4}x_4  \amp {}={}  \amp 1</mrow>
      <mrow>{2}x_1   \amp {}-{}   \amp {}x_2     \amp {}-{}  \amp {5}x_3   \amp {}-{}  \amp {}x_4  \amp {}={}  \amp 2</mrow>
      <mrow>{3}x_1   \amp {}+{}   \amp {7}x_2   \amp {}+{}  \amp {}x_3     \amp {}+{}  \amp {7}x_4  \amp {}={}  \amp 3</mrow>
    </md>
    as a vector equation as
    <men xml:id="eq_PA1e_1">
      x_1\left[ \begin{array}{c} 1\\2\\3 \end{array}  \right] + x_2\left[ \begin{array}{r} 4\\-1\\7 \end{array}  \right] + x_3\left[ \begin{array}{r} 2\\-5\\1 \end{array}  \right] + x_4\left[ \begin{array}{r} 4\\-1\\7 \end{array}  \right]= \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1\\2\\3 \end{array}  \right]
    </men>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can view the left hand side of Equation ( <xref ref="eq_PA1e_1"></xref>) as a
    <em>matrix-vector product</em>.
    Specifically,
    if <m>A = \left[ \begin{array}{crrr} 1\amp 4\amp 2\amp 4 \\ 2\amp -1\amp -5\amp -1 \\ 3\amp 7\amp 1\amp 7 \end{array} \right]</m> and <m>\vx = \left[ \begin{array}{c} x_1 \\x_2 \\x_3 \\x_4 \end{array} \right]</m>,
    then we define the <em>matrix-vector product</em>
    <m>A\vx</m> as the left hand side Equation <xref ref="eq_PA1e_1"/>.
    So the matrix-vector product <m>A\vx</m> is the linear combination of the columns of <m>A</m> with weights from the vector <m>\vx</m> in order.
  </p>
  <p>
    With this definition,
    the vector equation in <xref ref="eq_PA1e_1"/> can be expressed as a matrix-vector equation as
    <me>
      \left[ \begin{array}{crrr} 1\amp 4\amp 2\amp 4 \\ 2\amp -1\amp -5\amp -1 \\ 3\amp 7\amp 1\amp 7 \end{array}  \right] \left[ \begin{array}{c} x_1 \\x_2 \\x_3\\x_4 \end{array}  \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1\\2\\3 \end{array}  \right] \,
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We call this representation the
    <em>matrix-vector form</em> of the system.
    Note that the matrix <m>A</m> in this expression is the same as the coefficient matrix that appears in the augmented matrix representation of the system.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can use the above definition of the matrix-vector product as a linear combination with any matrix and any vector,
    as long as it is meaningful to use the entries in the vector as weights for the columns of the matrix.
    For example,
    for <m>A=\left[ \begin{array}{cc} 1\amp 2\\3\amp 1\\1\amp 1 \end{array}  \right]</m> and <m>\vv = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 3\\4 \end{array}  \right]</m>,
    then we can define <m>A\vv</m> to be the linear combination of the columns of <m>A</m> with weights 3 and 4:
    <me>
      A\vv= 3 \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1\\3\\1 \end{array}  \right] + 4 \left[ \begin{array}{c} 2\\1\\1 \end{array}  \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 11\\13\\7 \end{array}  \right] \,
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, note that if <m>\vv</m> had three entries,
    this definition would not make sense since we do not have three columns in <m>A</m>.
    In those cases, we say <m>A\vv</m> is not defined.
    We will later see that this definition can be generalized to matrix-matrix products,
    by treating the vector as a special case of a matrix with one column.

            As you might have noticed,
            systems with all the constants being 0 are special in that they always have a solution. (Why?) So we might consider grouping systems into two types: Those of the form <m>A \vx = \vb</m>,
            where not all of the entries of the vector <m>\vb</m> are <m>0</m>,
            and those of the form <m>A \vx = \vzero</m>,
            where <m>\vzero</m> is the vector of all zeros.
            Systems like <m>A \vx = \vb</m>,
            where <m>\vb</m> contains at least one non-zero entry,
            are called <em>nonhomogeneous</em>
              <idx><h>nonhomogeneous system</h></idx>
            systems, and systems of the form
            <m>A \vx = \vzero</m> are called <em>homogeneous</em>
              <idx><h>homogeneous system</h></idx>
            systems.
            For every nonhomogeneous system
            <m>A \vx = \vb</m> there is a corresponding homogeneous system <m>A \vx = \vzero</m>,
            and there is a useful connection between the solutions to the nonhomogeneous system and the corresponding homogeneous system.
            For example, consider the nonhomogeneous system
            <me>
              A \vx = \vb
            </me>
            with
            <men xml:id="eq_PA1e_2">
              A = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} 1 \amp  1 \amp  2  \\ 1 \amp  2 \amp  1 \end{array}  \right], \ \vx = \left[ \begin{array}{c} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{array}  \right], \ \text{ and }  \ \vb =  \left[ \begin{array}{r} 0 \\ -2 \end{array}  \right]
            </men>.
            The augmented matrix representation of this system is <m>[A \ | \ \vb]</m>.
            If we reduce this augmented matrix, we find
            <me>
              \left[ \begin{array}{ccr|r} 1 \amp  0 \amp  3 \amp  2 \\ 0 \amp  1 \amp  -1 \amp  -2 \end{array}  \right]
            </me>.
            From this RREF, we immediately see that the general solution is that <m>x_3</m> is free,
            <m>x_2 = x_3-2</m>, and <m>x_1 = 2-3x_3</m>.
            In vector form, we can represent this general solution as
            <men xml:id="eq_PA1e_3">
              \left[ \begin{array}{c} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{array}  \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 2-3x_3 \\ x_3-2 \\ x_3 \end{array}  \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{r} 2 \\ -2 \\ 0 \end{array}  \right] + x_3\left[ \begin{array}{r} -3 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{array}  \right]
            </men>.
            The rightmost expression above is called the
            <em>parametric vector form</em>
              <idx><h>parametric vector form</h></idx>
            of the solution.
            If we had a system where the general solution involved more than one free variable,
            then we would write the parametric vector form to include one vector multiplying each free variable.
            For example,
            if the general solution of a system were that <m>x_2</m> and <m>x_3</m> are free and <m>x_1=2+x_2+3x_3</m>,
            then the parametric vector form would be
            <me>
              \vx = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 2+ x_2+3x_3 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{array}  \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 2 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{array}  \right] + x_2 \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{array}  \right] + x_3 \left[ \begin{array}{c} 3 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{array}  \right] \,
            </me>.
            Note that the parametric vector form expresses the solutions as a linear combination of a number of vectors,
            depending on the number of free variables,
            with an added constant vector.
            This expression helps us in interpreting the solution set geometrically,
            as we will see in this section.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>

                  with <m>A</m> and <m>\vx</m> as in <xref ref="eq_PA1e_2"/> and compare it to the solution to the nonhomogeneous system in <xref ref="eq_PA1e_3"/>.

                  </me>
                  with
                  <me>
                    A = \left[ \begin{array}{ccr} 1\amp 2\amp -1 \\ 2\amp 4\amp -2 \end{array}  \right], \ \vx =  \left[ \begin{array}{c} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{array}  \right], \ \text{ and }  \ \vb =  \left[ \begin{array}{r} -1 \\ 1 \end{array}  \right]
                  </me>.
                  and express it in parametric vector form.
                  Then find the general solution to the corresponding homogeneous system and express it in parametric vector form.
                  How are the two solution sets related?
