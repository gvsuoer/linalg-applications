  <title>Project: Hamming Codes and the Hat Puzzle</title>
  <p>
    Recall the hat problem from the beginning of this section.
    Three players are assigned either a red or blue hat and can only see the colors of the hats of the other players.
    The goal is to devise a high probability strategy for one player to correctly guess the color of their hat.
    The players have a 50% chance of winning if one player guesses randomly and all of the others pass.
    However, the group can do better than 50% with a reasonably simple strategy.
    There are 2 possibilities for each hat color for a total of <m>2^3 = 8</m> possible distributions of hat colors.
    Of these, only red-red-red and blue-blue-blue contain only one hat color,
    so <m>6/8</m> of <m>3/4</m> of the possible hat distributions have two hats of one color and one of the other color.
    So if a player sees two hats of the same color,
    that player guesses the other color and passes otherwise.
    This gives a 75% chance of winning.
    This strategy will only work for three players, though.
    We want to develop an effective strategy that works for larger groups of players.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is a strategy, based on <term>Hamming codes</term>
    that can be utilized when the number of players is of the form <m>2^k-1</m> with <m>k \geq 2</m>.
    This strategy will provide a winning probability of
    <me>
      1 - 2^{-k}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that as <m>k \to \infty</m>,
    this probability has a limit of 1.
    Note also that if <m>k=2</m>
    (so that there are 3 players),
    then the probability is <m>\frac{3}{4}</m> or <m>75\%</m> <mdash/> the same strategy we came up with earlier.
  </p>
  <p>
    To understand this strategy,
    we need to build a slightly different kind of vector space than we have seen until now,
    one that is based on a binary choice of red or blue.
    To do so, we identify the hat colors with numbers <mdash/> 0 for red and 1 for blue.
    So let <m>\mathbb{F} = \{0,1\}</m>.
    Assume there are <m>n = 2^k-1</m> players for some integer <m>k \geq 2</m>.
    We can then view a distribution of hats among the
    <m>n = 2^k-1</m> players as a vector with <m>n</m> components from <m>\mathbb{F}</m>.
    That is,
    <me>
      \mathbb{F}^n = \{ [\alpha_1 \ \alpha_2 \ \cdots \ \alpha_n]^{\tr} : \alpha_i \in \mathbb{F}\}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can give some structure to both <m>\mathbb{F}</m> and
    <m>\mathbb{F}^n</m> by noting that we can define addition and multiplication in <m>\mathbb{F}</m> by
    <md>
      <mrow>{3} 0 + 0 \amp = 0,    \amp     0 + 1 \amp = 1 + 0 = 1, \amp   1+1 \amp = 0</mrow>
      <mrow>0 \cdot 0 \amp = 0,  \amp         0 \cdot 1 \amp = 1 \cdot 0 = 0, \amp    1 \cdot 1 \amp = 1</mrow>
    </md>.

    shows that <m>\mathbb{F}</m> has the same properties as <m>\R</m> <mdash/> that is that <m>\mathbb{F}</m> is a field.
    Until now, we have worked with vector spaces whose scalars come from the set of real numbers,
    but that is not necessary.
    None of the results we have discovered so far about vector spaces require our scalars to come from <m>\R</m>.
    In fact, we can replace <m>\R</m> with any field and all of the same vector space properties hold.
    It follows that <m>V = \mathbb{F}^n</m> is a vector space over <m>\mathbb{F}</m>.
    As we did in <m>\R^n</m>,
    we define the standard unit vectors <m>\ve_1 = [1 \ 0 \ 0 \ \cdots \ 0]^{\tr}</m>,
    <m>\ve_2 = [0 \ 1 \ 0 \ 0 \ \ldots \ 0]^{\tr}</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
    <m>\ve_n = [0 \ 0 \ 0 \ \ldots \ 0 \ 1]^{\tr}</m> in <m>V = \mathbb{F}^n</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now we return to the hat puzzle.
    We have <m>n = 2^k-1</m> players.
    Label the players <m>1</m>, <m>2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>n</m>.
    We can now represent a random placements of hats on heads as a vector
    <m>\vv = [\alpha_1 \ \alpha_2 \ \cdots \ \alpha_n]^{\tr}</m> in <m>V = \mathbb{F}^n</m>,
    where <m>\alpha_i = 0</m> in the <m>i</m>th entry represents a red hat and
    <m>\alpha_i =1</m> a blue hat on player <m>i</m>.
    Since player <m>i</m> can see all of the other hats,
    from player <m>i</m>'s perspective the distribution of hats has the form
    <me>
      \vv = \vv_i+ \beta_i \ve_i
    </me>,
    where <m>\beta_i</m> is the unknown color of hat on player <m>i</m>'s head and
    <me>
      \vv_i = [\alpha_1 \ \alpha_2 \ \cdots \ \alpha_{i-1} \ 0 \ \alpha_{i+1} \ \cdots \alpha_n]^{\tr}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to analyze the vectors <m>\vv</m> from player <m>i</m>'s perspective and to devise an effective strategy,
    we will partition the set <m>V</m> into an appropriate disjoint union of subsets.
  </p>
  <p>
    To provide a different way to look at players,
    we will use a subspace of <m>V</m>.
    Let <m>W</m> be a subspace of <m>V</m> that has a basis of <m>k</m> vectors.
    The elements of <m>W</m> are the linear combinations of <m>k</m> basis vectors,
    and each basis vector in a linear combination has 2 possibilities for its weight
    (from <m>\mathbb{F}</m>).
    Thus, <m>W</m> contains exactly <m>2^k = n+1</m> vectors.
    We can then use the <m>n=2^k-1</m> nonzero vectors in <m>W</m> to represent our players.
    Each distribution of hats can be seen as a linear combination of the vectors in <m>W</m>.
    Let <m>\vw_1</m>, <m>\vw_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
    <m>\vw_{2^k-1}</m> be the nonzero vectors in <m>W</m>.
    We then define a function <m>\varphi : V \to W</m> as
    <me>
      \varphi([\alpha_1 \ \alpha_2 \ \cdots \ \alpha_n]^{\tr}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i \vw_i
    </me>
    that identifies a distribution of hats with a vector in <m>W</m>.
    The subspace that we need to devise our strategy is what is called a Hamming code.

      Let
      <me>
        H = \left\{[\alpha_1 \ \alpha_2 \ \cdots \ \alpha_n]^{\tr} \in V : \sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i \vw_i = \vzero\right\}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Show that <m>H</m> is a subspace of <m>V</m>. (The subspace <m>H</m> is called the
      <m>\left(2^k-1, 2^k-k-1\right)</m> <term>Hamming code</term>
      (where the first component is the number of elements in a basis for <m>V</m> and the second the number of elements in a basis for <m>H</m>).
      Hamming codes are examples of linear codes <mdash/> those codes that are subspaces of the larger vector space.)

    Now for each <m>i</m> between 0 and <m>n</m> we define <m>H_i = \ve_i + H</m> as

      H_i = \ve_i + H = \{\ve_i + \vh : \vh \in H\}
    </me>,
    where we let <m>\ve_0 = \vzero</m>.
    The sets <m>H_i</m> are called <em>cosets</em> of <m>H</m>.

            Now we show that <m>V = \bigcup_{i=0}^n H_i</m> by demonstrating that
            <m>\bigcup_{i=0}^n H_i</m> has exactly the same number of elements as <m>V</m>.
            We will need one fact for our argument.
            We will see in a later section that <m>H</m> has a basis of <m>n-k</m> elements,

  <p>
    The useful idea from <xref ref="act_hat_3"></xref>
    is that any hat distribution in <m>V</m> is in exactly one of the sets <m>H_i</m>.
    Recall that a hat distribution
    <m>\vv = [\alpha_1 \ \alpha_2 \ \cdots \ \alpha_n]^{\tr}</m> in <m>V</m> can be written from player <m>i</m>'s perspective as
    <me>
      \vv = \vv_i + \beta_i \ve_i
    </me>,
    where <m>\vv_i =  [\alpha_1 \ \alpha_2 \ \cdots \ \alpha_{i-1} \ 0 \ \alpha_{i+1} \ \cdots \ \cdots \ \alpha_n]^{\tr}</m>.
    Our strategy for the hat game can now be revealed.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          If <m>\vv_i + \beta_i \ve_i</m> is not in <m>H</m> for either choice of <m>\beta_i</m>,
          then player <m>i</m> should pass.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If <m>\vv_i + \beta_i \ve_i</m> is in <m>H</m>,
          then player <m>i</m> guesses <m>1 + \beta_i</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

            Now we see determine that our strategy is a winning strategy for all hat distributions <m>\vv</m> that are not in <m>H</m>.
            First we need to know that these two options are the only ones.
            That is, show that it is not possible for
            <m>\vv_i + \beta_i \ve_i</m> to be in <m>H</m> for both choices of <m>\beta_i</m>.

            Now we want to demonstrate that this is a winning strategy if <m>\vv \notin H</m>.
            That is, at least one player guesses a correct hat color and no one else guesses incorrectly.
            So assume <m>\vv \notin H</m>.

              <statement>
                <p>
                  Finally, we need to argue that every player except player <m>i</m> must pass.
                  So consider player <m>j</m>, with <m>j \neq i</m>.
                  Recall that

                  </me>.
                  Analyze our strategy and the conditions under which player <m>j</m> does not pass.
