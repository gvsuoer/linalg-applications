  <title>Linear Systems with Infinitely Many Solutions</title>
  <p>
    Each of the systems that we solved so far have had a unique
    (exactly one)
    solution.
    The geometric representation of linear systems with two equations in two variables shows that 
    this does not always have to be the case.
    We also have linear systems with no solution and systems with infinitely many solutions.
    We now consider the problem of how to represent the set of solutions of a linear system that has 
    infinitely many solutions.
    (Systems with infinitely many solutions will also be of special interest to us a bit later when 
    we study eigenspaces of a matrix.)

            Part (b) shows that our system has infinitely many solutions.
            We were given solutions in part (b) <mdash/> but how do we find these solutions and how 
            do we know that these are all of the solutions?
            We address those questions now.
            If we apply row operations to the augmented matrix
            <me>
              \left[ \begin{array}{ccr|c} 1\amp 2\amp -1\amp 1 \\ 1\amp 1\amp -3\amp 0 \\ 2\amp 3\amp -4\amp 1 \end{array}  \right]
            </me>
            of this system,
            we can reduce this system to one with augmented matrix
            <me>
              \left[ \begin{array}{ccr|c} 1\amp 2\amp -1\amp 1 \\ 0\amp 1\amp 2\amp 1 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0 \end{array}  \right]

                  What is it about this reduced form of the augmented matrix that indicates that the

                  Since the system has infinitely many solutions,
                  we will not be able to explicitly determine values for each of the variables.
                  Instead, at least one of the variables can be chosen arbitrarily.
                  What is it about the reduced form of the augmented matrix that indicates that 
                  <m>x_3</m> is convenient to choose as the arbitrary variable?

                  (we call <m>x_3</m> a <em>free</em> variable),
                  use the second row to show that <m>x_2 = 1-2x_3</m>
                  (so that we can write <m>x_2</m> in terms of the arbitrary variable <m>x_3</m>).

    After using the elimination method,
    the first non-zero coefficient
    (from the left)
    of each equation in the linear system is in a different position.
    We call each such coefficient a <term>pivot</term>
    and a variable corresponding to a pivot a
    <term>basic variable</term>.
    In the system
    <md alignment="alignat">
      <mrow> {}a_2  \amp {}-{}   \amp {}a_1     \amp {}+{}  \amp {}a_0   \amp {}= \amp  \ {}\amp \amp {}2</mrow>

    </md>
    the basic variables are <m>a_2, a_1, a_0</m> for the first, second,
    and third equations, respectively.
    In the system,
    <md alignment="alignat">
      <mrow> {}x_1  \amp {}+{}   \amp {2}x_2   \amp {}-{}  \amp {}x_3   \amp {}= \amp  \ 1</mrow>
      <mrow>{}       \amp {}    \amp {}x_2     \amp {}+{}  \amp {2}x_3  \amp {}= \amp  \ 1</mrow>
      <mrow>{}     \amp {}     \amp {}       \amp {}    \amp {}0   \amp {}= \amp  0</mrow>
    </md>
    the basic variables are <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m> for the first and second equations,
    respectively,
    while the third equation does not have a basic variable.
    Through back-substitution,
    we can solve for each variable in a unique way if each appears as the basic variable in an equation.
    If, however, a variable is <term>free</term>,
    meaning that it is not the basic variable of an equation,
    we cannot solve for that variable explicitly.
    We instead assign a distinct parameter to each such free variable and solve for the basic variables 
    in terms of these parameters.

        The first non-zero coefficient

        in an equation in a linear system after elimination is called a <term>pivot</term>. 
        A variable corresponding to a pivot is a
        <term>basic variable</term>
        and while a variable not corresponding to a pivot is a

      Each matrix is an augmented matrix for a linear system after elimination.
      Identify the basic variables
      (if any)
      and free variables
      (if any).
      Then write the general solution
      (if there is a solution)
      expressing all variables in terms of the free variables.
      Use any symbols you like for the variables.

  <remark>
  <p>
    Does the existence of a row of 0's always mean a free variable?
    Can you think of an example where there is a row of 0's but none of the variables is free?
    How do the numbers of equations and the variables compare in that case?
