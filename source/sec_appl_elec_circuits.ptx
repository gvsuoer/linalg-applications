  <title>Application: Electrical Circuits</title>
  <p>
    Linear algebra is concerned with the study of systems of linear equations.
    There are two important aspects to linear systems.
    One is to use given information to set up a system of equations that represents the information
    (this is called <term>modeling</term>),
    and the other is to solve the system.
    As an example of modeling,
    we consider the application to the very simple electrical circuit.
    An electrical circuit consists of
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          one or more electrical sources,
          denoted by <image width="30%" source="1_a_pa_source"/>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          one or more resistors,
          denoted by <image width="30%" source="1_a_pa_resistor"/><nbsp/>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

    A source
    is a power supply like a battery, and a resistor 
    is an object that consumes the electricity,
    like a lamp or a computer.
    A simple circuit consists of one or more sources connected to resistors,
    like the one shown in <xref ref="F_circuit1"></xref>.
    The straight lines in the circuit indicate wires through which current flows.
    The points labeled P and Q are called
    <term>junctions</term> or <term>nodes</term>.

  <p>
    The source creates a charge that produces potential energy <m>E</m> measured in volts (V).
    Current flows out of the positive terminal of a source and runs through each branch of the circuit.
    Let <m>I_1</m>, <m>I_2</m>,
    and <m>I_3</m> be the currents as illustrated in <xref ref="F_circuit1"></xref>.
    The goal is to find the current flowing in each branch of the circuit.
  </p>
  <p>
    Linear algebra comes into play when analyzing a circuit based on the relationship between current <m>I</m>,
    resistance <m>R</m>, and voltage <m>E</m>.
    There are laws governing electrical circuits that state that <m>E = IR</m> across a resistor.
    Additionally, Kirchoff's Current and Voltage Laws indicate how current behaves within the whole circuit.
    Using all these laws together, we derive the system
    <md alignment="alignat">
      <mrow>{}I_1 \  \amp - \  \amp {}I_2 \  \amp + \  \amp {}I_3 \  \amp = 0</mrow>
      <mrow>5I_1 \  \amp + \  \amp 2I_2 \    \amp {} \   \amp {}  \    \amp = 8</mrow>
      <mrow>\  \amp {} \   \amp 2I_2 \    \amp + \  \amp 4I_3 \    \amp = 5</mrow>
    </md>,
    where <m>I_1</m>, <m>I_2</m>,
    and <m>I_3</m> are the currents at the points indicated in <xref ref="F_circuit1"></xref>.
    To finish analyzing the circuit,
    we now need to solve this system.
    In this section we will begin to learn systematic methods for solving systems of linear equations.
    More details about the derivation of these circuit equations can be found at the end of this section.
