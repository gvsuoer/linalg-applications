  <title>Dimensions of Eigenspaces</title>
  <p>
    There is a connection between the dimension of the eigenspace of a matrix corresponding to an eigenvalue and the multiplicity of that eigenvalue as a root of the characteristic polynomial.
    Recall that the dimension of a subspace of <m>\R^n</m> is the number of vectors in a basis for the eigenspace.
    We investigate the connection between dimension and multiplicity in the next activity.

            Consider now a <m>3\times 3</m> matrix with 3 distinct eigenvalues <m>\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3</m>.

              <statement>
                <p>
                  Recall that a polynomial of degree can have at most three distinct roots.
                  What does that say about the multiplicities of <m>\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3</m>?
                </p>

                <p>
                  Use the fact that eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are linearly independent to find the dimensions of the eigenspaces for <m>\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3</m>.

  <p>
    The examples in <xref ref="act_4_b_3"></xref>
    all provide instances of the principle that the dimension of an eigenspace corresponding to an eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m> cannot exceed the multiplicity of <m>\lambda</m>.
    Specifically:
  </p>

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>\lambda</m> is an eigenvalue of <m>A</m>,
        the dimension of the eigenspace corresponding to <m>\lambda</m> is less than or equal to the multiplicity of <m>\lambda</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    The examples we have seen raise another important point.
    The matrix <m>A = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} 1\amp 0\amp 1\\0\amp 1\amp 1\\0\amp 0\amp 2 \end{array} \right]</m> from our geometric example has two eigenvalues <m>1</m> and <m>2</m>,
    with the eigenvalue 1 having multiplicity 2.
    If we let <m>E_{\lambda}</m> represent the eigenspace of <m>A</m> corresponding to the eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m>,
    then <m>\dim(E_1)=2</m> and <m>\dim(E_2) = 1</m>.
    If we change this matrix slightly to the matrix
    <m>B = \left[ \begin{array}{crc} 2\amp 0\amp 1 \\ 0\amp 1\amp 1 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 1 \end{array} \right]</m> we see that <m>B</m> has two eigenvalues <m>1</m> and <m>2</m>,
    with the eigenvalue 1 having multiplicity 2.
    However, in this case we have
    <m>\dim(E_1) = 1</m> (like the example in from <xref ref="act_4_b_1"></xref>
    (a) and <xref ref="act_4_b_3"></xref> (a)).
    In this case the vector <m>\vv_1 = [1 \ 0 \ 0]^{\tr}</m> forms a basis for <m>E_2</m> and the vector
    <m>\vv_2 = [0 \ 1 \ 0]^{\tr}</m> forms a basis for <m>E_1</m>.
    We can visualize the action of <m>B</m> on the square formed by <m>\vv_1</m> and <m>\vv_2</m> in the <m>xy</m>-plane as a scaling by 2 in the <m>\vv_1</m> direction as shown in <xref ref="F_4_b_2"></xref>,
    but since we do not have a third linearly independent eigenvector,
    the action of <m>B</m> in the direction of <m>[0 \ 0 \ 1]^{\tr}</m> is not so clear.
  </p>

  <p>
    So the action of a matrix transformation can be more easily visualized if the dimension of each eigenspace is equal to the multiplicity of the corresponding eigenvalue.
    This geometric perspective leads us to define the geometric multiplicity of an eigenvalue.
