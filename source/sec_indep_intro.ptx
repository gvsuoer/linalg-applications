    In <xref ref="sec_vector_representation"></xref>
    we saw how to represent water-benzene-acetic acid chemical solutions with vectors,
    where the components represent the water,
    benzene and acid percentages.
    We then considered a problem of determining if a given chemical solution could be made by mixing other chemical solutions.
    Suppose we now have three different water-benzene-acetic acid chemical solutions,
    one with 40% water, 50% benzene and 10% acetic acid,
    the second with 52% water, 42% benzene and 6% acid,
    and a third with 46% water, 46% benzene and 8% acid.
    We represent the first chemical solution with the vector <m>\vv_1 = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 40\\50\\10 \end{array}  \right]</m>,
    the second with the vector <m>\vv_2 = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 52\\42\\6 \end{array}  \right]</m>,
    and the third with the vector <m>\vv_3 = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 46\\46\\8 \end{array}  \right]</m>.
    By combining these three chemical solutions we can make a chemical solution with 43% water, 48% benzene and 9% acid as follows
    <me>
      \frac{7}{12}\vv_1 + \frac{1}{12} \vv_2 + \frac{1}{3}\vv_3 = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 43\\48\\9 \end{array}  \right]
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, if we had noticed that the third chemical solution can actually be made from the first two, that is,
    <me>
      \frac{1}{2}\vv_1 + \frac{1}{2} \vv_2 = \vv_3
    </me>,
    we might have realized that we don't need the third chemical solution to make the 43% water, 48% benzene and 9% acid chemical solution.
    In fact,
    <me>
      \frac{3}{4}\vv_1 + \frac{1}{4} \vv_2 = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 43\\48\\9 \end{array}  \right]
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    (See <xref ref="ex_1_d_acid">Exercise</xref>
    of <xref ref="sec_vector_representation"></xref>.) Using the third chemical solution
    (represented by <m>\vv_3</m>)
    uses more information than we actually need to make the desired 43% water, 48% benzene and 9% acid chemical solution because the vector <m>\vv_3</m> is redundant <mdash/> all of the material we need to make <m>\vv_3</m> is contained in <m>\vv_1</m> and <m>\vv_2</m>.
    This is the basic idea behind linear independence <mdash/> representing information in the most efficient way.
  </p>
  <p>
    Information is often contained in and conveyed through vectors <mdash/> especially linear combinations of vectors.
    In this section we will investigate the concepts of linear dependence and independence of a set of vectors.
    Our goal is to be able to efficiently determine when a given set of vectors forms a
    <em>minimal spanning set</em>.
    A minimal spanning set is a spanning set that contains the smallest number of vectors to obtain all of the vectors in the span.
    An important aspect of a minimal spanning set is that every vector in the span can be written in one and only one way as a linear combination of the vectors in the minimal spanning set.
    This will allow us to define the important notion of the dimension of a vector space.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Review of useful information:</em>
    Recall that a linear combination of vectors <m>\vv_1</m>,
    <m>\vv_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
    <m>\vv_k</m> in <m>\R^n</m> is a sum of scalar multiples of <m>\vv_1</m>,
    <m>\vv_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\vv_k</m>.
    That is, a linear combination of the vectors <m>\vv_1</m>,
    <m>\vv_2</m>,
    <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\vv_k</m> is a vector of the form
    <me>
      c_1\vv_1 + c_2\vv_2 + \cdots + c_k\vv_k
    </me>,
    where <m>c_1</m>, <m>c_2</m>,
    <m>\ldots</m>, <m>c_k</m> are scalars.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recall also that the collection of all linear combinations of a set <m>\{\vv_1</m>,
    <m>\vv_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
    <m>\vv_k\}</m> of vectors in <m>\R^n</m> is called the span of the set of vectors.
    That is, the span <m>\Span \{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_k\}</m> of the set <m>\vv_1</m>,
    <m>\vv_2</m>,
    <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\vv_k</m> of vectors in <m>\R^n</m> is the set
    <me>
      \{c_1\vv_1 + c_2\vv_2 + \cdots + c_k\vv_k : \text{ where }  c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k \text{ are scalars } \}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example,
    a linear combination of vectors <m>\vv_1 = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1\\1\\2 \end{array}  \right]</m> and
    <m>\vv_2 = \left[ \begin{array}{r} 0\\-2\\1 \end{array}  \right]</m> is <m>2 \vv_1-3\vv_2 = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 2\\8\\1 \end{array}  \right]</m>.
    All linear combinations of these two vectors can be expressed as the collection of vectors of the form
    <m>\left[ \begin{array}{c} c_1\\c_1-2c_2\\2c_1+c_2 \end{array}  \right]</m> where <m>c_1, c_2</m> are scalars.
    Suppose we want to determine whether <m>\vw=\left[ \begin{array}{c} 1\\2\\3 \end{array}  \right]</m> is in the span,
    in other words if <m>\vw</m> is a linear combination of <m>\vv_1, \vv_2</m>.
    This means we are looking for <m>c_1, c_2</m> such that
    <me>
      \left[ \begin{array}{c} c_1\\c_1-2c_2\\2c_1+c_2 \end{array}  \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1\\2\\3 \end{array}  \right] \,
    </me>.
    we solve for the system represented with the augmented matrix
    <me>
      \left[\begin{array}{crc|c} 1\amp 0\amp \amp 1\\ 1\amp -2\amp \amp 2 \\ 2\amp 1\amp \amp 3 \end{array}  \right] \,
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    By reducing this matrix, we find that there are no solutions of the system,
    which implies that <m>\vw</m> is not a linear combination of <m>\vv_1, \vv_2</m>.
    Note that we can use any names we please for the scalars,
    say <m>x_1, x_2</m>, if we prefer.

      Let <m>\vv_1 = \left[ \begin{array}{r} 2\\1\\-3 \end{array}  \right]</m>,

            we saw that <m>\vb</m> could be written in infinitely many different ways as a linear combination of the vectors <m>\vv_1</m>,
            <m>\vv_2</m>, and <m>\vv_3</m>.
            However, the vector <m>\vb</m> could only be written in one way as a linear combination of <m>\vv_1</m> and <m>\vv_2</m>.
            So <m>\vb</m> is in <m>\Span \{\vv_1, \vv_2, \vv_3\}</m> and <m>\vb</m> is also in <m>\Span \{\vv_1, \vv_2\}</m>.
            This raises a question <mdash/> is <em>any</em>

            For the sake of efficiency,
