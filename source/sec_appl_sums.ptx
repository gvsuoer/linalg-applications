  <title>Application: Calculating Sums</title>
  <p>
    Consider the problem of calculating sums of powers of integers.
    For example,
    <md>
      <mrow>\sum_{t=0}^{n-1} t \amp = \frac{1}{2}\left(n^2-n\right)</mrow>
      <mrow>\sum_{t=0}^{n-1} t^2 \amp = \frac{1}{6}\left(2n^3-3n^2+1\right)</mrow>
      <mrow>\sum_{t=0}^{n-1} t^3 \amp = \frac{1}{4}\left(n^4-2n^3+n^2\right)</mrow>
    </md>
    and so on.
    It is possible to prove these formulas if we have an idea of what the formula is,
    but how can one come up with these formulas in the first place?
    As we will see later in this section,
    we can make use of coordinate vectors to find and verify such formulas.
