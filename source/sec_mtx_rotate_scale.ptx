  <title>Rotation and Scaling Matrices</title>
  <p>
    Recall that a rotation matrix is of the form
    <me>
      R_\theta= \left[ \begin{array}{cr} \cos(\theta)\amp -\sin(\theta) \\ \sin(\theta)\amp \cos(\theta) \end{array}  \right]
    </me>
    where the rotation is counterclockwise about the origin by an angle of <m>\theta</m> radians.
    In <xref ref="act_4e_1"></xref>,
    we considered the rotation matrix with angle <m>\pi/2</m> in counterclockwise direction.
    We will soon see that rotation matrices play an important role in the geometry of a matrix transformation for a matrix that has complex eigenvalues.
    In this activity,
    we will restrict ourselves to the <m>2 \times 2</m> case,
    but similar arguments can be made in higher dimensions.

      Let <m>A=\left[ \begin{array}{rc} 1\amp 1 \\ -1\amp 1 \end{array}  \right]</m>.

          <p>
            Explain why <m>A</m> is not a rotation matrix.

            Although <m>A</m> is not a rotation matrix,
            there is a rotation matrix <m>B</m> inside <m>A</m>.
            To find the matrix <m>B</m>,
            factor out <m>\sqrt{2}</m> from all entries of <m>A</m>.
            In other words,
            write <m>A</m> as a product of two matrices in the form
            <me>
              A = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} \sqrt{2} \amp 0 \\ 0\amp \sqrt{2} \end{array}  \right] B \;

          <p>
            The <m>B</m> matrix is a rotation matrix with an appropriate <m>\theta</m>.
            Find this <m>\theta</m>.

          <p>
            If we think about the product of two matrices as applying one transformation after another,
            describe the effect of the matrix transformation defined by <m>A</m> geometrically.

    More generally,
    if we have a matrix <m>A</m> of the form <m>A=\left[ \begin{array}{cr} a\amp -b \\ b\amp a \end{array}  \right]</m>, then
    <me>
      A = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} \sqrt{a^2+b^2} \amp 0 \\ 0\amp \sqrt{a^2+b^2} \end{array}  \right] \left[ \begin{array}{cc} \frac{a}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}\amp \frac{-b}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}} \\ \frac{b}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}\amp \frac{a}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}} \end{array}  \right] \,
    </me>.

  <idx><h>rotation-scaling matrices</h></idx>
    The first matrix in the decomposition is a scaling matrix with a scaling factor of <m>s=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}</m>.
    So if <m>s>1</m>, the transformation stretches vectors,
    and if <m>s\lt 1</m>, the transformation shrinks vectors.
    The second matrix in the decomposition is a rotation matrix with angle <m>\theta</m> such that
    <m>\cos(\theta)=\frac{a}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}</m> and <m>\sin(\theta)=\frac{b}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}</m>.
    This angle is also the angle between the positive <m>x</m>-axis and the vector <m>\vv=\left[ \begin{array}{c} a\\ b \end{array} \right]</m>.
    We will refer to the matrices of the form <m>\left[ \begin{array}{cr} a\amp -b \\ b\amp a \end{array} \right]</m> as
    <term>rotation-scaling matrices</term>.
