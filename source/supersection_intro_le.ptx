  <title>Application: Electrical Circuits</title>
  <p>
    Linear algebra is concerned with the study of systems of linear equations.
    There are two important aspects to linear systems.
    One is to use given information to set up a system of equations that represents the information
    (this is called <term>modeling</term>),
    and the other is to solve the system.
    As an example of modeling,
    we consider the application to the very simple electrical circuit.
    An electrical circuit consists of
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          one or more electrical sources,
          denoted by <nbsp/> <image width="30%" source="1_a_pa_source"/>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          one or more resistors,
          denoted by <nbsp/> <image width="30%" source="1_a_pa_resistor"/> .
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

    <idx><h>circuits</h><h>resistor</h></idx>
    <idx><h>circuits</h><h>junctions</h></idx>
    A source
    is a power supply like a battery, and a resistor 
    is an object that consumes the electricity,
    like a lamp or a computer.
    A simple circuit consists of one or more sources connected to resistors,
    like the one shown in <xref ref="F_circuit1"></xref>.
    The straight lines in the circuit indicate wires through which current flows.
    The points labeled P and Q are called
    <term>junctions</term> or <term>nodes</term>.
        
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="F_circuit1">
    <caption>A circuit.</caption>
    <image width="30%" source="1_a_pa_circuit1"/>
  </figure>
  <p>
    The source creates a charge that produces potential energy <m>E</m> measured in volts (V).
    Current flows out of the positive terminal of a source and runs through each branch of the circuit.
    Let <m>I_1</m>, <m>I_2</m>,
    and <m>I_3</m> be the currents as illustrated in <xref ref="F_circuit1"></xref>.
    The goal is to find the current flowing in each branch of the circuit.
  </p>
  <p>
    Linear algebra comes into play when analyzing a circuit based on the relationship between current <m>I</m>,
    resistance <m>R</m>, and voltage <m>E</m>.
    There are laws governing electrical circuits that state that <m>E = IR</m> across a resistor.
    Additionally, Kirchoff's Current and Voltage Laws indicate how current behaves within the whole circuit.
    Using all these laws together, we derive the system
    <md alignment="alignat">
      <mrow>{}I_1 \  \amp - \  \amp {}I_2 \  \amp + \  \amp {}I_3 \  \amp = 0</mrow>

      <mrow>\  \amp {} \   \amp 2I_2 \    \amp + \  \amp 4I_3 \    \amp = 5</mrow>
    </md>,
    where <m>I_1</m>, <m>I_2</m>,
    and <m>I_3</m> are the currents at the points indicated in <xref ref="F_circuit1"></xref>.
    To finish analyzing the circuit,
    we now need to solve this system.
    In this section we will begin to learn systematic methods for solving systems of linear equations.
    More details about the derivation of these circuit equations can be found at the end of this section.

  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>
    Systems of linear equations arise in almost every field of study:
    mathematics, statistics, physics,
    chemistry, biology, economics, sociology,
    computer science, engineering, and many, many others.
    We will study the theory behind solving systems of linear equations,
    implications of this theory,
    and applications of linear algebra as we proceed throughout this text.

            Consider the following system of two linear equations in two unknowns,
            <m>x_1, x_2</m>:
            <md alignment="alignat">
              <mrow>2x_1  \amp {}-{}  \amp 3x_2   \amp = 0</mrow>
              <mrow>x_1   \amp {}-{}   \amp x_2    \amp = 1</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
          <p>
            One way to solve such a system of linear equations is the method of substitution
            (where one equation is solved for one variable and then the resulting expression is 
            substituted into the remaining equations).
            This method works well for simple systems of two equations in two unknowns,
            but becomes complicated if the number or complexity of the equations is increased.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another method is elimination <mdash/> the method that we will adopt in this book.
            Recall that the elimination method works by multiplying each equation by a suitable 
            constant so that the coefficients of one of the variables in each equation is the same.
            Then we subtract corresponding sides of these equations to eliminate that variable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Use the method of elimination to show that this system has the unique solution 
            <m>x_1=3</m> and <m>x_2=2</m>.
            Explain the specific steps you perform when using elimination.

            the Cartesian plane,

            Represent the two equations <m>2x_1 -3x_2 = 0</m> and

  <title>Notation and Terminology</title>
  <p>
    To study linear algebra,
    we will need to agree on some general notation and terminology to represent our systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    An equation like <m>4x_1 + x_2 = 8</m> is called a linear equation because the variables 
    (<m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m> in this case) are raised to the first power,
    and there are no products of variables.
    The equation <m>4x_1 + x_2 = 8</m> is a linear equation in two variables,
    but we can make a linear equation with any number of variables we like.
  </p>

  <definition>
  <idx><h>linear equation</h></idx>
  <idx><h>linear equation</h><h>coefficients</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>linear equation</term>
            
        in the variables <m>x_1</m>, <m>x_2</m>,
        <m>\ldots</m>, <m>x_n</m> is an equation of the form
        <me>
          a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \cdots + a_nx_n = b
        </me>,
        where <m>n</m> is a positive integer and <m>a_1</m>, <m>a_2</m>,
        <m>\ldots</m>, <m>a_n</m> and <m>b</m> are constants.
        The constants <m>a_1</m>, <m>a_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
        <m>a_n</m> are called the <term>coefficients</term> of the equation.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    We can use any labels for the variables in a linear equation that we like,
    e.g., <m>I_1</m>, <m>x_1</m>, <m>t_1</m>,
    and you should become comfortable working with variables in any form.
    We will usually use subscripts,
    as in <m>x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots</m>,
    to represent the variables as this notation allows us to have any number of variables.
    Other examples of linear equations are
    <me>
      x+2y=4 \qquad \text{ and } \qquad \sqrt{2}x_1-3x_2=\frac{1}{4}x_3+\pi \,
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, the equations
    <me>
      \frac{1}{x}+y-z=0 \qquad \text{ and } \qquad 2x_1=\sqrt{x_2}-5
    </me>
    are non-linear equations.
  </p>

  <definition>
    <idx><h>system of linear equations</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>system of linear equations</term> is a collection of one or more linear equations 
        in the same variables.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    For example, the two equations
    <mdn alignment="alignat">
      <mrow number="no">x_1   \amp {}-{}  \amp x_2  \amp = 1</mrow>
      <mrow xml:id="eq_1_a_PA_1">2x_1   \amp {}+{}   \amp x_2  \amp = 5</mrow>
    </mdn>

    form a system of two linear equations in variables <m>x_1</m>,
    <m>x_2</m>.
  </p>

  <definition>
    <idx><h>system of linear equations</h><h>solution</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>solution</term> to a system of linear equations is an ordered <m>n</m>-tuple
        <m>(s_1, s_2, \ldots,
        s_n)</m> of numbers so that we obtain all true statements in the system when we replace the 
        variable in order with <m>s_1</m>,
        <m>s_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, and <m>s_n</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
   <idx><h>system of linear equations</h><h>solution set</h></idx>
    For example, <m>x_1=2, x_2=1</m>, or simply <m>(2,1)</m>,
    is a solution to the above system of linear equations in <xref ref="eq_1_a_PA_1"/> as can be 
    checked by substituting the variables into each equation.
    In solving a system of linear equations,
    we are interested in finding the set of all solutions,
    which we will call the <term>solution set of the system</term>.
       
    For the above system in <xref ref="eq_1_a_PA_1"/>,
    the solution set is the set containing the single point <m>(2,1)</m>,
    denoted <m>\{(2,1)\}</m>, because there is only one solution.
    If we consider just the equation <m>x_1-x_2=0</m> as our system,
    the solution set is the line <m>x_1=x_2</m> in the plane.
    More generally,
    a set of solutions is a collection of ordered <m>n</m>-tuples of numbers.
    We denote the set of all ordered <m>n</m>-tuples of numbers as <m>\R^n</m>.
    So, for example, <m>\R^2</m> is the set of all ordered pairs,
    or just the standard coordinate plane,
    and <m>\R^3</m> is the set of all ordered triples,
    or the three-dimensional space.

    In <xref ref="pa_1_a"></xref>,
    we were introduced to linear systems and the method of elimination for a system of two or three 
    variables.
    Our goal now is to come up with a systematic method that will reduce any linear system to one 
    that is easy to solve without changing the solution set of the system.
    Two linear systems will be called
    <term>equivalent</term> if 
    they have the same solution set.
  </p>
  <p>
    The operations we used in <xref ref="pa_1_a"></xref>
    to systematically eliminate variables so that we can solve a linear system are called
    <term>elementary operations on a system of linear equations</term>
    or just <term>elementary operations</term>.
    In the exercises you will argue that elementary operations do not change the solution set to a system of linear equations,
    a fact that is summarized in the following theorem.
  </p>

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The <term>elementary operations</term>
        on a system of linear equations:

        <ol marker="(1)">
          <li>
            <p>
              replacing one equation by the sum of that equation and a scalar multiple of another 
              equation;

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              interchanging two equations;

          <li>
            <p>
              replacing an equation by a nonzero scalar multiple of itself;
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        do not change the solution set to the system of equations.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    When we apply these elementary operations our ultimate goal is to produce a system of linear equations in a simplified form with the same solution set,
    where the number of variables eliminated from the equations increase as we move from top to bottom.
    This method is called the <em>elimination</em><idx><h>system of linear equations</h><h>elimination</h></idx> method.

  <activity>
    <introduction>
    <p>
      For systems of linear equations with a small number of variables,
      many different methods could be used to find a solution.
      However, when a system gets large,
      ad-hoc methods become unwieldy.
      One of our goals is to develop an algorithmic approach to solving systems of linear equations 
      that can be programmed and applied to any linear system,
      so we want to work in a very prescribed method as indicated in this activity.
      Ultimately, once we understand how the algorithm works,
      we will use calculators/computers to do the work.
      Apply the elimination method as described to show that the solution set of the following system 
      is <m>(2, -1, 1)</m>:

    <title>Important Note</title>
  <p>
    Technically,
    we don't really add two equations or multiply an equation by a scalar.
    When we refer to a scalar multiple of an equation,
    we mean the equation obtained by equating the scalar multiple of the expression on the left 
    side of the equation and the same scalar multiple of the expression on the right side of the equation.
    Similarly, when we refer to a sum of two equations,
    we don't really add the equations themselves.
    Instead, we mean the equation obtained by equating the sum of the expressions on the left sides
     of the equations to the sum of the expressions on the right sides of the equations.
    We will use the terminology
    <q>scalar multiple of an equation</q>
    and
    <q>sum of two equations</q>
    as shorthand to mean what is described here.
  </p>
  </paragraphs>

  <paragraphs>
    <title>Another Important Note</title>
  <p>
    There is an important and subtle point to consider here.
    When we use these operations to find a solution to a system of equations,
    we are assuming that the system has a solution.
    The application of these operations then tells us what a solution must look like.
    However, there is no guarantee that the outcome is actually a solution <mdash/> to be safe we 
    should check to make sure that our result is a solution to the system.
    In the case of linear systems, though,
    every one of our operations on equations is reversible
    (if applied correctly),
    so the result will always be a solution
    (but this is not true in general for non-linear systems).

    We are familiar with linear equations in two variables from basic algebra and calculus
    (through linear approximations).
    The set of solutions to a system of linear equations in two variables has some geometry connected 
    to it.

        There are exactly three possibilities for the number of solutions to a general system of two 
        linear equations in two unknowns.
        Describe the geometric representations of solution sets for each of the possibilities.
        Illustrate each with a specific example
        (of your own)
        using a system of equations and sketching its geometric representation.

    one solution, or infinitely many solutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now we consider systems of three variables.
    As an example,
    let us look at the linear equation <m>x+y+z=1</m> in the three variables <m>x</m>,
    <m>y</m>,
    and <m>z</m>.
    Notice that the points <m>(1,1,-2)</m>,
    <m>(0,0,0)</m>, and <m>(-1,-1,2)</m> all satisfy this equation.
    As a linear equation,
    the graph of <m>x+y+z=0</m> will be a plane in three dimensions that contains these three points,
    as shown in <xref ref="F_1_a_plane"></xref>.
    Hence when we consider a linear system in three unknowns,
    we are looking for a point in the three dimensional space that lies on all the planes described 
    by the equations.

    What follows are worked examples that use the concepts from this section.

    <solution>
      <p>
        We begin by eliminating the variable <m>x_1</m> from all but the first equation.
        To do so, we replace the third equation with the third equation minus the first equation to 
        obtain the equivalent system
        <md alignment="alignat">
          <mrow> {}x_1     \amp {}+{}  \amp {2}x_2   \amp {+}    \amp {}x_3  \amp {-}  \amp {}x_4  \amp = {}\amp 4\amp {}</mrow>

        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        Then we replace the fourth equation with the fourth equation minus 2 times the first to obtain 
        the equivalent system
        <md alignment="alignat">
          <mrow> {}x_1     \amp {}+{}  \amp {2}x_2   \amp {+}    \amp {}x_3  \amp {-}  \amp {}x_4  \amp = {}\amp 4\amp {}</mrow>

      </p>
      <p>
        To continue the elimination process,
        we want to eliminate the <m>x_2</m> variable from our latest third and fourth equations.
        To do so, we use the second equation so that we do not reinstate an <m>x_1</m> variable in 
        our new equations.
        We replace equation three with equation 3 minus 2 times equation 2 to produce the equivalent 
        system
        <md alignment="alignat">
          <mrow> {}x_1     \amp {}+{}  \amp {2}x_2   \amp {+}    \amp {}x_3  \amp {-}  \amp {}x_4  \amp = {}\amp 4\amp {}</mrow>

        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        Then we replace equation four with equation four minus 7 times equation 2, giving us the 
        equivalent system
        <md alignment="alignat">
          <mrow> {}x_1     \amp {}+{}  \amp {2}x_2   \amp {+}    \amp {}x_3  \amp {-}  \amp {}x_4  \amp = {}\amp 4\amp {}</mrow>
          <mrow>{}     \amp {}-{}  \amp {}x_2   \amp {-}    \amp {}x_3  \amp {+}  \amp {3}x_4  \amp = {}\amp 6\amp {}</mrow>

        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        With one more step we can determine the value of <m>x_4</m>.
        We use the last two equations to eliminate <m>x_3</m> from the fourth equation by replacing 
        equation four with equation four minus 2 times equation 3.
        This results in the equivalent system
        <md alignment="alignat">
          <mrow> {}x_1     \amp {}+{}  \amp {2}x_2   \amp {+}    \amp {}x_3  \amp {-}  \amp {}x_4  \amp = {}\amp 4\amp {}</mrow>
          <mrow>{}     \amp {}-{}  \amp {}x_2   \amp {-}    \amp {}x_3  \amp {+}  \amp {3}x_4  \amp = {}\amp 6\amp {}</mrow>
          <mrow>{}     \amp {}{}    \amp {}    \amp { }    \amp {3}x_3  \amp {-}  \amp {6}x_4  \amp = {-}\amp 15\amp {}</mrow>
          <mrow>{}     \amp {}{}    \amp {}     \amp {}    \amp {}    \amp {-}  \amp {6}x_4  \amp = {-}\amp 18\amp {.}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        The last equation tells us that <m>-6x_4 = -18</m>, or <m>x_4 =3</m>.
        Substituting into the third equation shows that
        <md alignment="alignat">
          <mrow>3x_3 - 6\left(3\right) \amp = -15</mrow>
          <mrow>3x_3 \amp = 3</mrow>
          <mrow>x_3 \amp = 1</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second equation shows that
        <md alignment="alignat">
          <mrow>-x_2 - 1 + 3\left(3\right) \amp = 6</mrow>
          <mrow>-x_2 \amp = -2</mrow>
          <mrow>x_2 \amp =2</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, the first equation tells us that
        <md alignment="alignat">
          <mrow>x_1 + 2\left(2\right) + 1 - 3 \amp = 4</mrow>
          <mrow>x_1 \amp = 2</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        So the solution to our system is <m>x_1 =2</m>, <m>x_2 = 2</m>,
        <m>x_3 = 1</m>, and <m>x_4 =3</m>.
        It is worth substituting back into our original system to check to make sure that we have not 
        made any arithmetic mistakes.

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A mining company has three mines.
        One day of operation at the mines produces the following output.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Mine 1 produces 25 tons of copper, 600 kilograms of silver and 15 tons of manganese.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Mine 2 produces 30 tons of copper, 500 kilograms of silver and 10 tons of manganese.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Mine 3 produces 20 tons of copper, 550 kilograms of silver and 12 tons of manganese.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose the company has orders for 550 tons of copper, 11350 kilograms of silver and 250 
        tons of manganese.
      </p>
      <p>
        Write a system of equations to answer the question:
        how many days should the company operate each mine to exactly fill the orders?
        State clearly what the variables in your system represent.
        Then find the general solution of your system.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        For our system,
        let <m>x_1</m> be the number of days mine 1 operates,
        <m>x_2</m> be the number of days mine 2 operates,
        and <m>x_3</m> be the number of days mine 3 operates.
        Since mine 1 produces 25 tons of copper each day,
        in <m>x_1</m> days mine 1 will produce <m>25x_1</m> tons of copper.
        Mine 2 produces 30 tons of copper each day,
        so in <m>x_2</m> days mine 2 will produce <m>30x_2</m> tons of copper.
        Also, mine 3 produces 20 tons of copper each day,
        so in <m>x_3</m> days mine 3 will produce <m>20x_3</m> tons of copper.
        Since the company needs to supply a total of 550 tons of copper,
        we need to have <m>25x_1+30x_2+20x_3 = 550</m>.
        Similar analyses of silver and manganese give us the system

      <p>
        To solve the system,
        we eliminate the variable <m>x_2</m> from the second and third equations by replacing equation 
        two with equation two minus 24 times equation one and replacing equation three with equation 
        three minus <m>\frac{3}{5}</m> times equation one.
        This produces the equvalent system

      </p>
      <p>
        We are fortunate now that we can determine the value of <m>x_2</m> from the third equation,
        which tells us that <m>x_2 = 10</m>.
        Substituting into the second equation shows that
        <md alignment="alignat">
          <mrow>-220(10) + 70x_3 \amp = -1850</mrow>

      </p>
      <p>
        Substituting into the first equation allows us to determine the value for <m>x_1</m>:

      <p>
        So the company should run mine 1 for 6 days,
        mine 2 for 10 days, and mine 3 for 5 days to meet this demand.

    In this section we introduced linear equations and systems of linear equations.

        <p>
          Informally, a linear equation is an equation in which each term is either a constant or a 
          constant times a variable.
          More formally,
          a linear equation in the variables <m>x_1</m>, <m>x_2</m>,
          <m>\ldots</m>, <m>x_n</m> is an equation of the form
          <me>
            a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \cdots + a_nx_n = b
          </me>,
          where <m>n</m> is a positive integer and <m>a_1</m>, <m>a_2</m>,

          Informally, a solution to a system of linear equations is a point that satisfies all of 
          the equations in the system.
          More formally,
          a solution to a system of linear equation in <m>n</m> variables <m>x_1</m>,
          <m>x_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
          <m>x_n</m> is an ordered <m>n</m>-tuple
