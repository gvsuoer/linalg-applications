  <title>Conditions for a Basis of a Vector Space</title>
  <p>
    There are two items we need to confirm before we can state that a subset <m>\CB</m> of a subspace <m>W</m> of a vector space is a basis for <m>W</m>:
    the set <m>\CB</m> must be linearly independent and span <m>W</m>.
    We can reduce the amount of work it takes to show that a set is a basis if we know the dimension of the vector space in advance.

      Let <m>W</m> be a subspace of a vector space <m>V</m> with <m>\dim(W) = k</m>.
      We know that every basis of <m>W</m> contains exactly <m>k</m> vectors.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>S</m> is a subset of <m>W</m> that contains <m>k</m> vectors and is linearly independent.
            In this part of the activity we will show that <m>S</m> must span <m>W</m>.

                  Suppose that <m>S</m> does not span <m>W</m>.
                  Explain why this implies that <m>W</m> contains a set of <m>k+1</m> linearly independent vectors.

                  Suppose that <m>S</m> is not linearly independent.
                  Explain why we can then find a proper subset of <m>S</m> that is linearly independent but has the same span as <m>S</m>.

    The result of <xref ref="act_5_c_5">Activity</xref>
    is summarized in the following theorem

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>W</m> be a subspace of dimension <m>k</m> of a vector space <m>V</m> and let <m>S</m> be a subset of <m>W</m> containing exactly <m>k</m> vectors.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>S</m> is linearly independent,
              then <m>S</m> is a basis for <m>W</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>S</m> spans <m>W</m>, then <m>S</m> is a basis for <m>W</m>.
