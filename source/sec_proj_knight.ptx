  <title>Project: Analyzing Knight Moves</title>
  <p>
    To understand where a knight can move in a chess game,
    we need to know the initial setup.
    A chess board is an <m>8 \times 8</m> grid.
    To be able to refer to the individual positions on the board,
    we will place the board so that its lower left corner is at the origin,
    make each square in the grid have side length <m>1</m>,
    and label each square with the point at the lower left corner.
    This is illustrated at left in <xref ref="F_knight_2"></xref>.
  </p>

    </sidebyside>
  </figure>
  <p>
    Each player has two knights to start the game,
    for one player the knights would begin in positions <m>(1,0)</m> and <m>(6,0)</m>.
    Because of the symmetry of the knight's moves,
    we will only analyze the moves of the knight that begins at position <m>(1,0)</m>.
    This knight has only three allowable moves from its starting point
    (assuming that the board is empty),
    as shown at right in <xref ref="F_knight_2"></xref>.
    The questions we will ask are:
    given any position on the board,
    can the knight move from its start position to that position using only knight moves and,
    what sequence of moves will make that happen.
    To answer these questions we will use linear combinations of knight moves described as vectors.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each knight move can be described by a vector.
    A move one position to the right and two up can be represented as <m>\vn_1 = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1\\2 \end{array}  \right]</m>.
    Three other moves are <m>\vn_2 = \left[ \begin{array}{r} -1\\2 \end{array}  \right]</m>,
    <m>\vn_3 = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 2\\1 \end{array}  \right]</m>,
    and <m>\vn_4 = \left[ \begin{array}{r} -2\\1 \end{array}  \right]</m>.
    The other four knight moves are the additive inverses of these four.
    Any sequence of moves by the knight is given by the linear combination
    <me>
      x_1 \vn_1 + x_2 \vn_2 + x_3 \vn_3 + x_4 \vn_4
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    A word of caution: the knight can only make complete moves,
    so we are restricted to integer
    (either positive or negative)
    values for <m>x_1</m>, <m>x_2</m>,
    <m>x_3</m>, and <m>x_4</m>.
    You can use the GeoGebra app at <url href="https://www.geogebra.org/m/dfwtskrj" visual="geogebra.org/m/dfwtskrj"></url>
    to see the effects the weights have on the knight moves.
    We should note here that since addition of vectors is commutative,
    the order in which we apply our moves does not matter.
    However, we may need to be careful with the order so that our knight does not leave the 
    chess board.

            </me>
            will tell us if it is possible for the knight to move from its initial 
            position at <m>(1,0)</m> to the position (5,2).

            If it is possible to find a sequence of moves that take the knight from its 
            initial position to position <m>(5,2)</m>,
            find weights <m>x_1</m>, <m>x_2</m>,
            <m>x_3</m>, and <m>x_4</m> to accomplish this move.
            (Be careful <mdash/> we must have solutions in which <m>x_1</m>,
            <m>x_2</m>, <m>x_3</m>, and <m>x_4</m> are integers.)
            Is there more than one sequence of possible moves?

    shows that it is possible for our knight to move to position <m>(5,2)</m> on the board.
    We would like to know if it is possible to move to any position on the board.
    That is, we would like to know if the integer span of the four moves <m>\vn_1</m>,
    <m>\vn_2</m>, <m>\vn_3</m>,
    and <m>\vn_4</m> will allow our knight to cover the entire board.
    This takes a bit more work.

  <p>
    To answer our question if our knight can reach any position,
    we now need to determine if we can always find integer values of <m>x_3</m> and 
    <m>x_4</m> to make equations <xref ref="eq_knight_x1"/> and 
    <xref ref="eq_knight_x2"/> have integer solutions.
    In other words,
    we need to find values of <m>x_3</m> and <m>x_4</m> so that <m>-5x_3+3x_4+b+2(a-1)</m> and
    <m>3x_3-5x_4+b-2(a-1)</m> are multiples of <m>4</m>.
    How we do this could depend on the parity
    (even or odd)
    of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
    For example, if <m>a</m> is odd and <m>b</m> is even,
    say <m>a = 2r+1</m> and <m>b = 2s</m> for some integers <m>r</m> and <m>s</m>, then
    <md>
      <mrow>x_1 \amp = \frac{1}{4}\left( -5x_3 + 3x_4 + 2s + 4r\right)</mrow>
      <mrow>x_2 \amp = \frac{1}{4}\left( 3x_3 - 5x_4 + 2s - 4r \right)</mrow>
    </md>.
  </p>
  <p>
    With a little trial and error we can see that if we let <m>x_3 = x_4 = s</m>,
    then <m>x_1 = r</m> and <m>x_2 = -r</m> is a solution with integer weights.
    For example,
    when <m>a=5</m> and <m>b=2</m> we have <m>r=2</m> and <m>s = 1</m>.
    This makes <m>x_1 = 2</m>,
    <m>x_2 = -2</m>, <m>x_3 = 1 = x_4</m>.
    Compare this to the solution(s) you found in <xref ref="act_knight_1"></xref>.
    This analysis shows us how to move our knight to any position <m>(a,b)</m> where 
    <m>a</m> is odd and <m>b</m> is even.

    shows that for any position on the chess board,
    using linear combinations of move vectors,
    we can find a sequence of moves that takes our knight to that position.
    (We actually haven't shown that these moves can be made so that our knight always stays 
    on the board <mdash/> we leave that question to you.)
