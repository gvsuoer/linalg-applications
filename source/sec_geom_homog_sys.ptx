  <title>The Geometry of Solutions to the Homogeneous System</title>
  <p>
    There is a simple geometric interpretation to the solution set of the homogeneous system
    <m>A \vx = \vzero</m> based on the number of free variables that imposes a geometry on the solution set of the corresponding nonhomogeneous system <m>A \vx = \vb</m>
    (when consistent)
    due to <xref ref="thm_1_e_1">Theorem</xref>.

      In this activity we consider geometric interpretations of the solution sets of homogeneous and nonhomogeneous systems.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Consider the system <m>A \vx = \vb</m> where
            <m>A = \left[ \begin{array}{rr} 1 \amp -3 \\ -3 \amp 9 \\ -1 \amp 3 \end{array} \right]</m> and <m>\vb = \left[ \begin{array}{r} 2 \\ -6 \\ -2 \end{array} \right]</m>.
            The general solution to this system has the form <m>\left[ \begin{array}{c} 2 \\ 0 \end{array} \right] + x_2\left[ \begin{array}{c} 3 \\ 1 \end{array} \right]</m>,
            where <m>x_2</m> is any real number.

                  Let <m>\vv = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 3 \\ 1 \end{array} \right]</m>.
                  What does the set of all vectors of the form <m>x_2\vv</m> look like geometrically?
                  Draw a picture in <m>\R^2</m> to illustrate.
                  (Recall that we refer to all the vectors of the form <m>x_2\vv</m> simply as <m>\Span \{\vv\}</m>.)

                  Let <m>\vp = \left[ \begin{array}{r} 2 \\ 0 \end{array} \right]</m>.
                  What effect does adding the vector <m>\vp</m> to each vector in
                  <m>\Span \{\vv\}</m> have on the geometry of <m>\Span \{\vv\}</m>?
                  Finally, what does this mean about the geometry of the solution set to the nonhomogeneous system <m>A \vx = \vb</m>?

        <li>
          <p>
            Consider the system <m>A \vx = \vb</m> where
            <m>A =\left[ \begin{array}{ccr} 1\amp 2\amp -1 \\ 3\amp 6\amp -3 \end{array} \right]</m> and <m>\vb = \left[ \begin{array}{r} -2 \\ -6 \end{array} \right]</m>.
            The general solution to this system has the form <m>\left[ \begin{array}{r} -2 \\ 0 \\0 \end{array} \right] + x_2\left[ \begin{array}{r} -2 \\ 1 \\0 \end{array} \right] +x_3\left[ \begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 0 \\1 \end{array} \right]</m>,

                  Use our results from Section 4 to determine the geometric shape of <m>\Span \{\vu, \vv\}</m>,
                  the set of all vectors of the form <m>x_2\left[ \begin{array}{r} -2 \\ 1 \\0 \end{array} \right] +x_3\left[ \begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 0 \\1 \end{array} \right]</m>,

                  What's the geometric effect of adding the vector <m>\vp</m> to each vector in <m>\Span \{\vu, \vv\}</m>?
                  Finally, what does this mean about the geometry of the solution set to the nonhomogeneous system <m>A \vx = \vb</m>?

  <p>
    Our work in the above activity shows the geometric shape of the solution set of a consistent nonhomogeneous system is the same as the geometric shape of the solution set of the corresponding homogeneous system.
    The only difference between the two solution sets is that one is a shifted version of the other.
