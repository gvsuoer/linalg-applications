  <title>Project: GPS and Least Squares</title>
  <p>
    In this project we discuss some of the details about how the GPS works.
    The idea is based on intersections of spheres.
    To build a basic understanding of the system,
    we begin with a 2-dimensional example.

      Suppose that there are three base stations <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>,
      and <m>C</m> in <m>\R^2</m> that can send and receive signals from your mobile phone.
      Assume that <m>A</m> is located at point <m>(-1,-2)</m>,
      <m>B</m> at point <m>(36,5)</m>,
      and <m>C</m> at point <m>(16,35)</m>.
      Also assume that your mobile phone location is point <m>(x,y)</m>.
      Based on the time that it takes to receive the signals from the three base stations,
      it can be determined that your distance to base station <m>A</m> is <m>28</m> km,
      your distance to base station <m>B</m> is <m>26</m> km,
      and your distance to base station <m>C</m> is <m>14</m> km using a coordinate system with measurements in kilometers based on a reference point chosen to be <m>(0,0)</m>.
      Due to limitations on the measurement equipment,
      these measurements all contain some unknown error which we will denote as <m>z</m>.
      The goal is to determine your location in <m>\R^2</m> based on this information.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the distance readings were accurate,
      then the point <m>(x,y)</m> would lie on the circle centered at <m>A</m> of radius <m>29</m>.
      The distance from <m>(x,y)</m> to base station <m>A</m> can be represented in two different ways:
      <m>28</m> km and <m>\sqrt{(x+1)^2 + (y+2)^2}</m>.
      However, there is some error in the measurements
      (due to the receiver clock and satellite clocks not being snychronized),
      so we really have
      <me>
        \sqrt{(x+1)^2 + (y+2)^2} + z = 28
      </me>,
      where <m>z</m> is the error.
      Similarly, <m>(x,y)</m> must also satisfy
      <me>
        \sqrt{(x-36)^2 + (y-5)^2} + z = 26
      </me>
      and
      <me>
        \sqrt{(x-16)^2 + (y-35)^2} + z = 14
      </me>.

            If all measurements were accurate,
            your position would be at the intersection of the circles centered at <m>A</m> with radius <m>28</m> km,
            centered at <m>B</m> with radius <m>26</m> km,
            and centered at <m>C</m> with radius <m>14</m> km as shown in <xref ref="F_GPS_circles"></xref>.
            Even though the figure might seem to imply it,
            because of the error in the measurements the three circles do not intersect in one point.
            So instead, we want to find the best estimate of a point of intersection that we can.
            The system of <xref ref="eq_GPS_2D_1">equations</xref>,

            is non-linear and can be difficult to solve,
            if it even has a solution.
            To approximate a solution, we can linearize the system.
            To do this, show that if we subtract corresponding sides of equation  <xref ref="eq_GPS_2D_1"/> from <xref ref="eq_GPS_2D_2"/> and expand both sides,
            we can obtain the linear equation

            Use technology to find a pseudoinverse of the coefficient matrix of this system.

    Project <xref ref="act_GPS_plane_ex"></xref>
    provides the basic idea behind GPS. Suppose you receive a signal from a GPS satellite.
    The transmission from satellite <m>i</m> provides four pieces of information <mdash/> a location
    <m>(x_i,y_i,z_i)</m> and a time stamp <m>t_i</m> according to the satellite's atomic clock.
    The time stamp allows the calculation of the distance between you and the <m>i</m>th satellite.
    The transmission travel time is calculated by subtracting the current time on the GPS receiver from the satellite's time stamp.
    Distance is then found by multiplying the transmission travel time by the rate,
    which is the speed of light <m>c=299792.458</m> km/s.<fn>
    The signals travel in radio waves,
    which are electromagnetic waves,
    and travel at the speed of light.
    Also, <m>c</m> is the speed of light in a vacuum,
    but atmosphere is not too dense so we assume this value of <m>c</m>
    </fn> So distance is found as <m>c(t_i-d)</m>,
    where <m>d</m> is the time at the receiver.
    This signal places your location within in a sphere of that radius from the center of the satellite.
    If you receive a signal at the same time from two satellites,
    then your position is at the intersection of two spheres.
    As can be seen at left in <xref ref="F_Spheres"></xref>,
    that intersection is a circle.
    So your position has been narrowed quite a bit.
    Now if you receive simultaneous signals from three spheres,
    your position is narrowed to the intersection of three spheres,
    or two points as shown at right in <xref ref="F_Spheres"></xref>.
    So if we could receive perfect information from three satellites,
    then your location would be exactly determined.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is a problem with the above analysis <mdash/> calculating the distances.
    These distances are determined by the time it takes for the signal to travel from the satellite to the GPS receiver.
    The times are measured by the clocks in the satellites and the clocks in the receivers.
    Since the GPS receiver clock is unlikely to be perfectly synchronized with the satellite clock,
    the distance calculations are not perfect.
    In addition,
    the rate at which the signal travels can change as the signal moves through the ionosphere and the troposphere.
    As a result,
    the calculated distance measurements are not exact,
    and are referred to as <em>pseudoranges</em>.
    In our calculations we need to factor in the error related to the time discrepancy and other factors.
    We will incorporate these errors into our measure of <m>d</m> and treat <m>d</m> as an unknown.
    (Of course, this is all more complicated that is presented here,
    but this provides the general idea.)
  </p>
  <p>
    To ensure accuracy, the GPS uses signals from four satellites.
    Assume a satellite is positioned at point
    <m>(x_1,y_1,z_1)</m> at a distance <m>d_1</m> from the GPS receiver located at point <m>(x,y,z)</m>.
    The distance can also be measured in two ways: as
    <me>
      \sqrt{(x-x_1)^2+(y-y_1)^2+(z-z_1)^2}
    </me>.
    and as <m>c(t_1-d)</m>.
    So
    <me>
      c(t_1-d) = \sqrt{(x-x_1)^2 + (y-y_1)^2 + (z-z_1)^2}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Again, we are treating <m>d</m> as an unknown,
    so this equation has the four unknowns <m>x</m>,
    <m>y</m>, <m>z</m>, and <m>d</m>.
    Using signals from four satellites produces the system of equations
    <md>
      <mrow xml:id="eq_GPS_1_sqrt" number="yes">\sqrt{(x-x_1)^2 + (y-y_1)^2 + (z-z_1)^2} \amp =  c(t_1-d)</mrow>

      The system of equations <xref ref="eq_GPS_1_sqrt"/>,

      and <xref ref="eq_GPS_4_sqrt"/> is a non-linear system and is difficult to solve,
      if it even has a solution.
      We want a method that will provide at least an approximate solution as well as apply if we use more than four satellites.
      We choose a reference node (say
      <m>(x_1, y_1, z_1)</m>) and make calculations relative to that node as we did in Project <xref ref="act_GPS_plane_ex"></xref>.

            and <xref ref="eq_GPS_4_sqrt"/> to remove the roots.
            Then subtract corresponding sides of the new first equation (involving

            where <m>h_i = x_i^2 + y_i^2 + z_i^2</m>.

    We conclude this project with a final note.
    At times a GPS receiver may only be able to receive signals from three satellites.
    In these situations,
    the receiver can substitute the surface of the Earth as a fourth sphere and continue the computation.
