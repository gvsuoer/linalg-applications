  <title>The Span of a Set of Vectors</title>
  <p>
    As we saw in the previous section,
    the question of whether a system of linear equations has a solution is equivalent to the 
    question of whether the vector obtained by the non-coefficient constants in the system is a 
    linear combination of the vectors obtained from the columns of the coefficient matrix of the system.
    So if we were interested in finding for which constants the system has a solution,
    we would look for the collection of all linear combinations of the columns.
    We call this collection the <term>span</term> of these vectors.
    In this section we investigate the concept of span both algebraically and geometrically.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our work in <xref ref="pa_1_d"></xref>
    seems to indicate that the span of a set of vectors,
    i.e., the collection of all linear combinations of this set of vectors,
    has a nice structure.
    As we mentioned above,
    the span of a set of vectors represents the collection of all constant vectors for which a 
    linear system has a solution,
    but we will also see that other important objects in linear algebra can be represented as 
    the span of a set of vectors.

        The <term>span</term>
        of the vectors <m>\vv_1</m>, <m>\vv_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
        <m>\vv_m</m> in <m>\R^n</m> is the collection of all linear combinations of the vectors 
        <m>\vv_1</m>,
        <m>\vv_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\vv_m</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>

  <title>Notation</title>
  <p>
    We denote the span of a set of vectors <m>\vv_1</m>,
    <m>\vv_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\vv_m</m> as
    <me>
      \Span \{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_m\}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    So
    <me>
      \Span \{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_m\}  = \{c_1\vv_1+c_2\vv_2 + \cdots + c_m \vv_m : c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_m \text{ are scalars } \}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The curly braces, <m>\{ \; \}</m>,
    are used in denoting sets.
    They represent the whole set formed by the objects included between them.
    So <m>\{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_m\}</m> represents the collection of the vectors formed by
    <m>\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_m</m> for an arbitrary number <m>m</m>.
    Note that <m>m</m> can be 1, meaning that the collection can contain only one vector <m>\vv_1</m>.
  </p>
  </paragraphs>

  <p>
    We now investigate what the span of a set of one or two vectors is,
    both from an algebraic and geometric perspective,
    and consider what happens for more general spanning sets.

            By definition,

            Determine which vectors are in this collection.
            If we plot all these vectors with each vector being represented as a point in the plane,
