  <title>The Span of a Set of Vectors</title>
  <p>
    As we saw in the previous section,
    the question of whether a system of linear equations has a solution is equivalent to the question of whether the vector obtained by the non-coefficient constants in the system is a linear combination of the vectors obtained from the columns of the coefficient matrix of the system.
    So if we were interested in finding for which constants the system has a solution,
    we would look for the collection of all linear combinations of the columns.
    We call this collection the <em>span</em> of these vectors.
    In this section we investigate the concept of span both algebraically and geometrically.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our work in Preview <xref ref="pa_1_d">Activity</xref>
    seems to indicate that the span of a set of vectors,
    i.e., the collection of all linear combinations of this set of vectors,
    has a nice structure.
    As we mentioned above,
    the span of a set of vectors represents the collection of all constant vectors for which a linear system has a solution,
    but we will also see that other important objects in linear algebra can be represented as the span of a set of vectors.

    <statement>
      <p>
        The <term>span</term>
            <idx><h>span</h></idx>
        of the vectors <m>\vv_1</m>, <m>\vv_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
        <m>\vv_m</m> in <m>\R^n</m> is the collection of all linear combinations of the vectors <m>\vv_1</m>,
        <m>\vv_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\vv_m</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    <em>Notation:</em> We denote the span of a set of vectors <m>\vv_1</m>,
    <m>\vv_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\vv_m</m> as
    <me>
      \Span \{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_m\}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    So
    <me>
      \Span \{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_m\}  = \{c_1\vv_1+c_2\vv_2 + \cdots + c_m \vv_m : c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_m \text{ are scalars } \}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The curly braces, <m>\{ \; \}</m>,
    are used in denoting sets.
    They represent the whole set formed by the objects included between them.
    So <m>\{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_m\}</m> represents the collection of the vectors formed by
    <m>\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_m</m> for an arbitrary number <m>m</m>.
    Note that <m>m</m> can be 1, meaning that the collection can contain only one vector <m>\vv_1</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We now investigate what the span of a set of one or two vectors is,
    both from an algebraic and geometric perspective,
    and consider what happens for more general spanning sets.
