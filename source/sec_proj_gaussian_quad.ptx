  <p>
    Simpson's rule is a reasonably accurate method for approximating definite integrals since it models the integrand on subintervals with quadratics.
    For that reason, Simpson's rule provides exact values for integrals of all polynomials of degree less than or equal to 2.
    In Gaussian quadrature,
    we will use a family of polynomials to determine points at which to evaluate an integral of the form <m>\int_{-1}^1 f(t) \ dt</m>.
    By allowing ourselves to select evaluation points that are not uniformly distributed across the interval of integration,
    we will be able to approximate our integrals much more efficiently.
    The method is constructed so as to obtain exact values for as large of degree polynomial integrands as possible.
    As a result,
    if we can approximate our integrand well with polynomials,
    we can obtain very good approximations with Gaussian quadrature with minimal effort.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Gaussian quadrature
    approximation has the form
    <men xml:id="eq_GQ">
      \int_{-1}^1 f(t) \ dt \approx w_1f(t_1) + w_2 f(t_2) + \cdots + w_n f(t_n) = \sum_{i=1}^n w_if(t_i)
    </men>,
    where the <m>w_i</m> (weights) and the <m>t_i</m> (nodes) are points in the interval <m>[-1,1]</m><fn>
    As we will see later,
    integrations over <m>[a,b]</m> can be converted to an integral over <m>[-1,1]</m> with a change of variable.
    </fn>.
    Gaussian quadrature describes how to find the weights and the points in <xref ref="eq_GQ"/> to obtain suitable approximations.
    We begin to explore Gaussian quadrature with the simplest cases.

      In this case we will use <m>f(t)=1</m>,

    Other than solving a system of linear equations as in <xref ref="act_GQ_2"></xref>,
    it might be reasonable to ask what the connection is between Gaussian quadrature and linear algebra.
    We explore that connection now.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the general case,
    we want to find the weights and nodes to make the approximation exact for as large degree polynomials as possible.
    We have <m>2n</m> unknowns <m>w_1</m>,
    <m>w_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
    <m>w_n</m> and <m>t_1</m>, <m>t_2</m>,
    <m>\ldots</m>, <m>t_n</m>,
    so we need to impose <m>2n</m> conditions to determine the unknowns.
    We will require equality for the <m>2n</m> functions <m>t^i</m> for <m>i</m> from 0 to <m>2n-1</m>.
    This yields the equations

    In the <m>i</m>th equation the right hand side is

      It is inefficient to always solve these systems of equations to find the nodes and weights,

            Now we will see the more elegant way to find the nodes.
            As we will show for some cases,
            the nodes can be found as roots of a set of orthogonal polynomials in <m>\pol_n</m> with the inner product <m>\langle f(t),
            g(t) \rangle = \int_{-1}^1 f(t)g(t) \ dt</m>.
            Begin with the basis <m>\CS_n = \{1, t, t^2, \ldots,
            t^n\}</m> of <m>\pol_n</m>.
            Use appropriate technology to find an orthogonal basis <m>B_5</m> for <m>\pol_5</m> obtained by applying the Gram-Schmidt process to <m>\CS_n</m>.
            The polynomials in this basis are called
            <term>Legendre polynomials</term>.
            Check that the nodes are roots of the Legendre polynomials by finding roots of these polynomials using any method.
            Explain why the <m>t_i</m> appear to be roots of the Legendre polynomials.

  <p>
    Although it would take us beyond the scope of this project to verify this fact,
    the nodes in the <m>n</m>th Gaussian quadrature approximation <xref ref="eq_GQ"/> are in fact the roots of the <m>n</m>th order Legendre polynomial.
    In other words,
    if <m>p_n(t)</m> is the <m>n</m>th order Legendre polynomial,
    then <m>t_1</m>, <m>t_2</m>,
    <m>\ldots</m>,
    <m>t_n</m> are the roots of <m>p_n(t)</m> in <m>[-1,1]</m>.
    Gaussian quadrature as described in <xref ref="eq_GQ"/> using the polynomial <m>p_n(t)</m> is exact if the integrand <m>f(t)</m> is a polynomial of degree less than <m>2n</m>.

    <m>w_i</m>, using the formula<fn>
