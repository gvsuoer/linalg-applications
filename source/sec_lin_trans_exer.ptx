        We have seen that <m>C[a,b]</m>,
        the set of all continuous functions on the interval <m>[a,b]</m> is a vector space.
        Let <m>T : C[a,b] \to \R</m> be defined by <m>T(f) = \int_a^b f(x) \, dx</m>.
        Show that <m>T</m> is a linear transformation.

        If <m>V</m> is a vector space,
        prove that the identity map <m>I:V \to V</m> defined by

        Let <m>V</m> and <m>W</m> be vector spaces and let <m>T : V \to W</m> be an isomorphism.
        Since <m>T</m> is a bijection,
        <m>T</m> has an inverse function. (Recall that two functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are inverses if
        <m>(f \circ g)(x) = x</m> for all <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>g</m> and

              Let <m>T: \pol_1 \to \R^2</m> be defined by <m>T(a_0+a_1t) = \left[ \begin{array}{c} a_0\\a_0+a_1 \end{array} \right]</m>.
              Assume that <m>T</m> is an isomorphism.

              Let <m>T: \M_{2 \times 2} \to \pol_3</m> be defined by <m>T\left(\left[ \begin{array}{cc} a\amp b\\ c\amp d \end{array} \right] \right) = a+bt+ct^2+dt^3</m>.
              Assume that <m>T</m> is an isomorphism.
              Find the inverse of <m>T</m>.
              Make sure to verify that your conjectured function really is the inverse of <m>T</m>.

              Now assume that <m>T</m> is an arbitrary isomorphism from a vector space <m>V</m> to a vector space <m>W</m>.
              We know that the inverse <m>T^{-1}</m> of <m>T</m> satisfies the property that
              <m>T^{-1}(\vw) = \vv</m> whenever <m>T(\vv) = \vw</m>.
              From previous courses you have probably shown that the inverse of a bijection is a bijection.
              You may assume this as fact.
              Show that <m>T^{-1}</m> is a linear transformation and,
              consequently, an isomorphism.

        Determine which of the following is true.
        If a statement is true, verify it.
        If a statement is false, give a counterexample.
        (The result of this exercise,
        along with <xref ref="ex_8_a_reflexive_isomorphism">Exercises</xref>
        and <xref ref="ex_8_a_inverse_isomorphism"></xref>,
        shows that the isomorphism relation is reflexive,
        symmetric, and transitive.
        Thus, isomorphism is an equivalence relation.)

        There is an important characterization of linear functionals that we examine in this problem.
        A linear functional is a linear transformation from a vector space <m>V</m> to <m>\R</m>.
        Let <m>V</m> be a finite-dimensional inner product space,
        and let <m>T: V \to \R</m> be a linear functional.
        We will show that there is a vector <m>\vx</m> in <m>V</m> such that

          T(\vv) = \langle \vv, \vx \rangle
        </me>
