              Now assume that <m>T</m> is an arbitrary isomorphism from a vector space <m>V</m> to a vector space <m>W</m>.
              We know that the inverse <m>T^{-1}</m> of <m>T</m> satisfies the property that

              From previous courses you have probably shown that the inverse of a bijection is a bijection.
              You may assume this as fact.

      <p>
        There is an important characterization of linear functionals that we examine in this problem.
        A linear functional is a linear transformation from a vector space <m>V</m> to <m>\R</m>.
        Let <m>V</m> be a finite-dimensional inner product space,
        and let <m>T: V \to \R</m> be a linear functional.
        We will show that there is a vector <m>\vx</m> in <m>V</m> such that
        <me>
          T(\vv) = \langle \vv, \vx \rangle
        </me>
        for every vector <m>\vv</m> in <m>V</m>.
        That is, every linear functional on an inner product space can be represented by an inner product with a fixed vector.
        Let <m>n = \dim(V)</m>.
