  <title>Application: The Lights Out Game</title>
  <p>
    Lights Out (LO) is a commercial game released by Tiger Toys in 1995
    (later bought out by Hasbro).
    The game consists of a <m>5 \times 5</m> grid in which each square is either lit or unlit.
    Pressing a square changes the status of the square itself and all the squares to the left, right,
    up, or down.
    The player's job is to turn all the lights out.
    You can play a sample game at <url href="https://www.geogebra.org/m/wcmctahp" visual="geogebra.org/m/wcmctahp"/>. There is a method to solve any solvable Lights Out game that can be uncovered through linear algebra that we will uncover later in this section.
    Column spaces and null spaces play important roles in this method.
