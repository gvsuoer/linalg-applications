  <title>Notation and Terminology</title>
  <p>
    To study linear algebra,
    we will need to agree on some general notation and terminology to represent our systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    An equation like <m>4x_1 + x_2 = 8</m> is called a linear equation because the variables 
    (<m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m> in this case) are raised to the first power,
    and there are no products of variables.
    The equation <m>4x_1 + x_2 = 8</m> is a linear equation in two variables,
    but we can make a linear equation with any number of variables we like.
  </p>

  <definition>
  <idx><h>linear equation</h></idx>
  <idx><h>linear equation</h><h>coefficients</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>linear equation</term>
            
        in the variables <m>x_1</m>, <m>x_2</m>,
        <m>\ldots</m>, <m>x_n</m> is an equation of the form
        <me>
          a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \cdots + a_nx_n = b
        </me>,
        where <m>n</m> is a positive integer and <m>a_1</m>, <m>a_2</m>,
        <m>\ldots</m>, <m>a_n</m> and <m>b</m> are constants.
        The constants <m>a_1</m>, <m>a_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
        <m>a_n</m> are called the <term>coefficients</term> of the equation.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    We can use any labels for the variables in a linear equation that we like,
    e.g., <m>I_1</m>, <m>x_1</m>, <m>t_1</m>,
    and you should become comfortable working with variables in any form.
    We will usually use subscripts,
    as in <m>x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots</m>,
    to represent the variables as this notation allows us to have any number of variables.
    Other examples of linear equations are
    <me>
      x+2y=4 \qquad \text{ and } \qquad \sqrt{2}x_1-3x_2=\frac{1}{4}x_3+\pi \,
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, the equations
    <me>
      \frac{1}{x}+y-z=0 \qquad \text{ and } \qquad 2x_1=\sqrt{x_2}-5
    </me>
    are non-linear equations.
  </p>

  <definition>
    <idx><h>system of linear equations</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>system of linear equations</term> is a collection of one or more linear equations 
        in the same variables.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    For example, the two equations
    <mdn alignment="alignat">
      <mrow number="no">x_1   \amp {}-{}  \amp x_2  \amp = 1</mrow>
      <mrow xml:id="eq_1_a_PA_1">2x_1   \amp {}+{}   \amp x_2  \amp = 5</mrow>
    </mdn>

    form a system of two linear equations in variables <m>x_1</m>,
    <m>x_2</m>.
  </p>

  <definition>
    <idx><h>system of linear equations</h><h>solution</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>solution</term> to a system of linear equations is an ordered <m>n</m>-tuple
        <m>(s_1, s_2, \ldots,
        s_n)</m> of numbers so that we obtain all true statements in the system when we replace the 
        variable in order with <m>s_1</m>,
        <m>s_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, and <m>s_n</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
   <idx><h>system of linear equations</h><h>solution set</h></idx>
    For example, <m>x_1=2, x_2=1</m>, or simply <m>(2,1)</m>,
    is a solution to the above system of linear equations in <xref ref="eq_1_a_PA_1"/> as can be 
    checked by substituting the variables into each equation.
    In solving a system of linear equations,
    we are interested in finding the set of all solutions,
    which we will call the <term>solution set of the system</term>.
       
    For the above system in <xref ref="eq_1_a_PA_1"/>,
    the solution set is the set containing the single point <m>(2,1)</m>,
    denoted <m>\{(2,1)\}</m>, because there is only one solution.
    If we consider just the equation <m>x_1-x_2=0</m> as our system,
    the solution set is the line <m>x_1=x_2</m> in the plane.
    More generally,
    a set of solutions is a collection of ordered <m>n</m>-tuples of numbers.
    We denote the set of all ordered <m>n</m>-tuples of numbers as <m>\R^n</m>.
    So, for example, <m>\R^2</m> is the set of all ordered pairs,
    or just the standard coordinate plane,
    and <m>\R^3</m> is the set of all ordered triples,
    or the three-dimensional space.
