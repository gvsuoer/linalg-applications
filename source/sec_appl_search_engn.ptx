  <title>Application: Search Engines and Semantics</title>

  <p>
    Effective search engines search for more than just words.
    Language is complex and search engines must deal with the fact that there are often many ways to express a given concept
    (this is called <term>synonymy</term>,
    that multiple words can have the same meaning),
    and that a single word can have multiple meanings
    (<term>polysemy</term>).
    As a consequence,
    a search on a word may provide irrelevant matches (e.g., searching for <em>derivative</em>
    could provide pages on mathematics or financial securities) or you might search for articles on <em>cats</em>
    but the paper you really want uses the word <em>felines</em>.
    A better search engine will not necessarily try to match terms,
    but instead retrieve information based on concept or intent.
    Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI)
    (or <term>Latent Semantic Analysis</term>),
    developed in the late 1980s,
    helps search engines determine concept and intent in order to provide more accurate and relevant results.
    LSI essentially works by providing underlying (latent) relationships between words (semantics) that search engines need to provide context and understanding
    (indexing).
    LSI provides a mapping of both words and documents into a lower dimensional
    <q>concept</q>
    space, and makes the search in this new space.
    The mapping is provided by the singular value decomposition.
