  <title>Application: Rotations in 3D</title>
  <p>
    An aircraft in flight, like a plane or the space shuttle,
    can perform three independent rotations:
    <em>roll</em>, <em>pitch</em>, and <em>yaw</em>.
    Roll is a rotation about the axis through the nose and tail of the aircraft,
    pitch is rotation moving the nose of the aircraft up or down through the axis from wingtip to wingtip,
    and yaw is the rotation when the nose of the aircraft turns left or right about the axis though the plane from top to bottom.
    These rotations take place in <m>3</m>-space and the axes of the rotations change as the aircraft travels through space.
    To understand how aircraft maneuver,
    it is important to know about general rotations in space.
    These are more complicated than rotations in <m>2</m>-space, and,
    as we will see later in this section, involve orthogonal sets.
