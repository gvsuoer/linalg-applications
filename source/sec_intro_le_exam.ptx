    What follows are worked examples that use the concepts from this section.

  <example>
    <statement>

        Apply the allowable operations on equations to solve the system

      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        We begin by eliminating the variable <m>x_1</m> from all but the first equation.
        To do so, we replace the third equation with the third equation minus the first equation to 
        obtain the equivalent system
        <md alignment="alignat">
          <mrow> {}x_1     \amp {}+{}  \amp {2}x_2   \amp {+}    \amp {}x_3  \amp {-}  \amp {}x_4  \amp = {}\amp 4\amp {}</mrow>
          <mrow>{}     \amp {}-{}  \amp {}x_2   \amp {-}    \amp {}x_3  \amp {+}  \amp {3}x_4  \amp = {}\amp 6\amp {}</mrow>
          <mrow>{}     \amp {}-{}  \amp {2}x_2   \amp {+}    \amp {}x_3  \amp {}  \amp {}    \amp = {-}\amp 3\amp {}</mrow>
          <mrow>{2}x_1   \amp {}-{}  \amp {3}x_2   \amp {+}    \amp {}x_3  \amp {+}  \amp {}x_4  \amp = {}\amp 2\amp {.}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        Then we replace the fourth equation with the fourth equation minus 2 times the first to obtain 
        the equivalent system
        <md alignment="alignat">
          <mrow> {}x_1     \amp {}+{}  \amp {2}x_2   \amp {+}    \amp {}x_3  \amp {-}  \amp {}x_4  \amp = {}\amp 4\amp {}</mrow>
          <mrow>{}     \amp {}-{}  \amp {}x_2   \amp {-}    \amp {}x_3  \amp {+}  \amp {3}x_4  \amp = {}\amp 6\amp {}</mrow>
          <mrow>{}     \amp {}-{}  \amp {2}x_2   \amp {+}    \amp {}x_3  \amp {}  \amp {}    \amp = {-}\amp 3\amp {}</mrow>
          <mrow>{}     \amp {}-{}  \amp {7}x_2   \amp {-}    \amp {}x_3  \amp {+}  \amp {3}x_4  \amp = {-}\amp 6\amp {.}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        To continue the elimination process,
        we want to eliminate the <m>x_2</m> variable from our latest third and fourth equations.
        To do so, we use the second equation so that we do not reinstate an <m>x_1</m> variable in 
        our new equations.
        We replace equation three with equation 3 minus 2 times equation 2 to produce the equivalent 
        system
        <md alignment="alignat">
          <mrow> {}x_1     \amp {}+{}  \amp {2}x_2   \amp {+}    \amp {}x_3  \amp {-}  \amp {}x_4  \amp = {}\amp 4\amp {}</mrow>
          <mrow>{}     \amp {}-{}  \amp {}x_2   \amp {-}    \amp {}x_3  \amp {+}  \amp {3}x_4  \amp = {}\amp 6\amp {}</mrow>
          <mrow>{}     \amp {}{}    \amp {}    \amp { }    \amp {3}x_3  \amp {-}  \amp {6}x_4  \amp = {-}\amp 15\amp {}</mrow>
          <mrow>{}     \amp {}-{}  \amp {7}x_2   \amp {-}    \amp {}x_3  \amp {+}  \amp {3}x_4  \amp = {-}\amp 6\amp {.}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        Then we replace equation four with equation four minus 7 times equation 2, giving us the 
        equivalent system
        <md alignment="alignat">
          <mrow> {}x_1     \amp {}+{}  \amp {2}x_2   \amp {+}    \amp {}x_3  \amp {-}  \amp {}x_4  \amp = {}\amp 4\amp {}</mrow>
          <mrow>{}     \amp {}-{}  \amp {}x_2   \amp {-}    \amp {}x_3  \amp {+}  \amp {3}x_4  \amp = {}\amp 6\amp {}</mrow>
          <mrow>{}     \amp {}{}    \amp {}    \amp { }    \amp {3}x_3  \amp {-}  \amp {6}x_4  \amp = {-}\amp 15\amp {}</mrow>
          <mrow>{}     \amp {}{}    \amp {}     \amp { }    \amp {6}x_3  \amp {-}  \amp {18}x_4  \amp = {-}\amp 48\amp {.}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        With one more step we can determine the value of <m>x_4</m>.
        We use the last two equations to eliminate <m>x_3</m> from the fourth equation by replacing 
        equation four with equation four minus 2 times equation 3.
        This results in the equivalent system
        <md alignment="alignat">
          <mrow> {}x_1     \amp {}+{}  \amp {2}x_2   \amp {+}    \amp {}x_3  \amp {-}  \amp {}x_4  \amp = {}\amp 4\amp {}</mrow>
          <mrow>{}     \amp {}-{}  \amp {}x_2   \amp {-}    \amp {}x_3  \amp {+}  \amp {3}x_4  \amp = {}\amp 6\amp {}</mrow>
          <mrow>{}     \amp {}{}    \amp {}    \amp { }    \amp {3}x_3  \amp {-}  \amp {6}x_4  \amp = {-}\amp 15\amp {}</mrow>
          <mrow>{}     \amp {}{}    \amp {}     \amp {}    \amp {}    \amp {-}  \amp {6}x_4  \amp = {-}\amp 18\amp {.}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        The last equation tells us that <m>-6x_4 = -18</m>, or <m>x_4 =3</m>.
        Substituting into the third equation shows that
        <md alignment="alignat">
          <mrow>3x_3 - 6\left(3\right) \amp = -15</mrow>
          <mrow>3x_3 \amp = 3</mrow>
          <mrow>x_3 \amp = 1</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second equation shows that
        <md alignment="alignat">
          <mrow>-x_2 - 1 + 3\left(3\right) \amp = 6</mrow>
          <mrow>-x_2 \amp = -2</mrow>
          <mrow>x_2 \amp =2</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, the first equation tells us that
        <md alignment="alignat">
          <mrow>x_1 + 2\left(2\right) + 1 - 3 \amp = 4</mrow>
          <mrow>x_1 \amp = 2</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        So the solution to our system is <m>x_1 =2</m>, <m>x_2 = 2</m>,
        <m>x_3 = 1</m>, and <m>x_4 =3</m>.
        It is worth substituting back into our original system to check to make sure that we have not 
        made any arithmetic mistakes.

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A mining company has three mines.
        One day of operation at the mines produces the following output.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Mine 1 produces 25 tons of copper, 600 kilograms of silver and 15 tons of manganese.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Mine 2 produces 30 tons of copper, 500 kilograms of silver and 10 tons of manganese.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Mine 3 produces 20 tons of copper, 550 kilograms of silver and 12 tons of manganese.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose the company has orders for 550 tons of copper, 11350 kilograms of silver and 250 
        tons of manganese.
      </p>
      <p>
        Write a system of equations to answer the question:
        how many days should the company operate each mine to exactly fill the orders?
        State clearly what the variables in your system represent.
        Then find the general solution of your system.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        For our system,
        let <m>x_1</m> be the number of days mine 1 operates,
        <m>x_2</m> be the number of days mine 2 operates,
        and <m>x_3</m> be the number of days mine 3 operates.
        Since mine 1 produces 25 tons of copper each day,
        in <m>x_1</m> days mine 1 will produce <m>25x_1</m> tons of copper.
        Mine 2 produces 30 tons of copper each day,
        so in <m>x_2</m> days mine 2 will produce <m>30x_2</m> tons of copper.
        Also, mine 3 produces 20 tons of copper each day,
        so in <m>x_3</m> days mine 3 will produce <m>20x_3</m> tons of copper.
        Since the company needs to supply a total of 550 tons of copper,
        we need to have <m>25x_1+30x_2+20x_3 = 550</m>.
        Similar analyses of silver and manganese give us the system

      <p>
        To solve the system,
        we eliminate the variable <m>x_2</m> from the second and third equations by replacing equation 
        two with equation two minus 24 times equation one and replacing equation three with equation 
        three minus <m>\frac{3}{5}</m> times equation one.
        This produces the equvalent system

      </p>
      <p>
        We are fortunate now that we can determine the value of <m>x_2</m> from the third equation,
        which tells us that <m>x_2 = 10</m>.
        Substituting into the second equation shows that
        <md alignment="alignat">
          <mrow>-220(10) + 70x_3 \amp = -1850</mrow>
          <mrow>70x_3 \amp = 350</mrow>
          <mrow>x_3 \amp = 5</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Substituting into the first equation allows us to determine the value for <m>x_1</m>:
        <md alignment="alignat">
          <mrow>25x_1 + 30(10) + 20(5) \amp = 550</mrow>
          <mrow>25x_1 \amp = 150</mrow>
          <mrow>x_1 \amp = 6</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        So the company should run mine 1 for 6 days,
        mine 2 for 10 days, and mine 3 for 5 days to meet this demand.
      </p>
    </solution>
