  <title>Determining Linear Independence</title>
  <p>
    The definition and our previous work give us a straightforward method for determining when a set of vectors in <m>\R^n</m> is linearly independent or dependent.

      In this activity we learn how to use a matrix to determine in general if a set of vectors in <m>\R^n</m> is linearly independent or dependent.
      Suppose we have <m>k</m> vectors <m>\vv_1</m>,
      <m>\vv_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\vv_k</m> in <m>\R^n</m>.
      To see if these vectors are linearly independent,
      we need to find the solutions to the vector equation
      <men xml:id="eq_lin_indep">
        x_1 \vv_1 + x_2 \vv_2 + \cdots + x_k \vv_k = \vzero
      </men>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we let <m>A = [\vv_1 \ \vv_2 \ \vv_3 \ \cdots \ \vv_k]</m> and <m>\vx = \left[ \begin{array}{c} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \vdots \\ x_k \end{array} \right]</m>,
      then we can write the vector equation <xref ref="eq_lin_indep"/> in matrix form <m>A \vx = \vzero</m>.
      Let <m>B</m> be the reduced row echelon form of <m>A</m>.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            What can we say about the pivots of <m>B</m> in order for
            <m>A \vx = \vzero</m> to have exactly one solution?
            Under these conditions, are the vectors <m>\vv_1</m>, <m>\vv_2</m>,
            <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\vv_k</m> linearly independent or dependent?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            What can we say about the rows or columns of <m>B</m> in order for
            <m>A \vx = \vzero</m> to have infinitely many solutions?
            Under these conditions, are the vectors <m>\vv_1</m>, <m>\vv_2</m>,
            <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\vv_k</m> linearly independent or dependent?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Use the result of parts (a) and (b) to determine if the vectors <m>\vv_1 = \left[ \begin{array}{r} 1 \\ -1 \\ 2 \\ 0 \end{array} \right]</m>,
            <m>\vv_2 = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 0 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{array} \right]</m>,
            and <m>\vv_3 = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 0 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{array} \right]</m> in <m>\R^4</m> are linearly independent or dependent.
            If dependent,
            write one of the vectors as a linear combination of the others.
            You may use the fact that the matrix
            <m>\left[ \begin{array}{rcc} 1\amp 1\amp 0 \\ -1\amp 0\amp 0 \\ 2\amp 2\amp 2 \\ 0\amp 3\amp 1 \end{array} \right]</m> is row equivalent to <m>\left[ \begin{array}{rcc} 1\amp 0\amp 0 \\ 0\amp 1\amp 0 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 1 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 0 \end{array} \right]</m>.
