  <title>Linear Combinations of Vectors</title>
  <p>
    The concept of linear combinations is one of the fundamental ideas in linear algebra.
    We will use linear combinations to describe almost every important concept in linear 
    algebra <mdash/> the span of a set of vectors,
    the range of a linear transformation, bases,
    the dimension of a vector space <mdash/> to name just a few.
  </p>
  <p>
    In <xref ref="pa_1_d"></xref>,
    we considered the sets of all scalar multiples of a single nonzero vector in 
    <m>\R^2</m> and in <m>\R^3</m>.
    We also considered the set of all sums of scalar multiples of two nonzero vectors.
    These results so far gives us an idea of geometrical descriptions of sets of vectors 
    generated by one or two vectors.
    Oftentimes we are interested in what vectors can be made from a given collection of vectors.
    For example,
    suppose we have two different water-benzene-acetic acid chemical solutions,
    one with 40% water, 50% benzene and 10% acetic acid,
    the other with 52% water, 42% benzene and 6% acid.
    An experiment we want to conduct requires a chemical solution with 43% water, 48% benzene 
    and 9% acid.
    We would like to know if we make this new chemical solution by mixing the first two 
    chemical solutions,
    or do we have to run to the chemical solutions market to get the chemical solution we want.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can set up a system of equations for each ingredient and find the answer.
    But we can also consider each chemical solution as a vector,
    where the components represent the water,
    benzene and acid percentages.
    So the two chemical solutions we have are represented by the vectors
    <m>\vv_1 = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 40\\50\\10 \end{array}  \right]</m> and 
    <m>\vv_2 = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 52\\42\\6 \end{array}  \right]</m>.
    If we mix the two chemical solutions with varying amounts of each ingredient,
    then the question of whether we can make the desired chemical solution becomes the 
    question of whether the equation
    <me>
      c_1\left[ \begin{array}{c} 40\\50\\10 \end{array}  \right]+ c_2\left[ \begin{array}{c} 52\\42\\6 \end{array}  \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 43\\48\\9 \end{array}  \right]
    </me>
    has a solution.
    (You will determine if this equation has a solution in <xref ref="ex_1_d_acid"></xref>.)
  </p>
  <p>
    We might also be interested in what other chemical solutions we can make from the two given solutions.
    This amounts to determining which vectors can be written in the form
    <m>c_1\left[ \begin{array}{c} 40\\50\\10 \end{array} \right]+ c_2\left[ \begin{array}{c} 52\\42\\6 \end{array} \right]</m> 
    for scalars <m>c_1</m> and <m>c_2</m>.
    Vectors that are created from sums of scalar multiples of given vectors are called linear 
    combinations of those vectors.
    More formally,

  <definition xml:id="x1_d_linear_combination">
  <idx><h>linear combination</h></idx>
  <idx><h>linear combination</h><h>weights</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>linear combination</term>
        of vectors <m>\vv_1</m>, <m>\vv_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
        <m>\vv_m</m> in <m>\R^n</m> is any vector of the form
        <men xml:id="eq_lin_comb">
          c_1 \vv_1 + c_2 \vv_2 + \cdots + c_m \vv_m
        </men>,
        where <m>c_1</m>, <m>c_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
        <m>c_m</m> are scalars that we will refer to as the <term>weights</term>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    In the chemical solutions example,
    the vector <m>c_1\left[ \begin{array}{c} 40\\50\\10 \end{array} \right]+ c_2\left[ \begin{array}{c} 52\\42\\6 \end{array} \right]</m> 
    for scalars <m>c_1</m> and <m>c_2</m> is a linear combination of the vectors 
    <m>\left[ \begin{array}{c} 40\\50\\10 \end{array} \right]</m> and
    <m>\left[ \begin{array}{c} 52\\42\\6 \end{array} \right]</m> with weights <m>c_1</m> and <m>c_2</m>,
    and the set of linear combinations of the given chemical solution vectors tells us exactly which 
    chemical solutions we can make from the given ones.
    This is one example of how linear combinations can arise in applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    The set of all linear combinations of a fixed collection of vectors has a very nice algebraic 
    structure and,
    in small dimensions,
    allows us to use a geometrical description to aid our understanding.
    In the above example,
    this collection gives us the type of chemical solutions we can make by combining the first two 
    solutions in varying amounts.

      Our chemical solution example illustrates that it can be of interest to determine whether certain vectors can be written as a linear combination of given vectors.
      We explore that idea in more depth in this activity.
      Let <m>\vv_1=\left[ \begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{array}  \right]</m> and 
      <m>\vv_2=\left[ \begin{array}{r} 2 \\ -1 \\ 3 \end{array}  \right]</m>.

            (scalar multiples)
            1 and 2.
            The resulting vector is a vector which can be written as a linear combination of <m>\vv_1</m> and <m>\vv_2</m>.

            Let <m>\vw = \left[ \begin{array}{r} 0 \\ 6 \\ -2 \end{array}  \right]</m>.
            The problem of determining if <m>\vw</m> is a linear combination of <m>\vv_1</m> 
            and <m>\vv_2</m> is equivalent to the problem of finding scalars <m>x_1</m> and 
            <m>x_2</m> so that
            <men xml:id="eq_vect_eq1">
              \vw = x_1 \vv_1 + x_2 \vv_2

                  Combine the vectors on the right hand side of equation <xref ref="eq_vect_eq1"/> 
                  into one vector,
                  and then set the components of the vectors on both sides equal to each other to 
                  convert the vector equation <xref ref="eq_vect_eq1"/> to a linear system of 
                  three equations in two variables.

                  Use row operations to find a solution, if it exists,
                  to the system you found in the previous part of this activity.
                  If you find a solution,
                  verify in <xref ref="eq_vect_eq1"/> that you have found appropriate weights to 
                  produce the vector <m>\vw</m> as a linear combination of <m>\vv_1</m> and <m>\vv_2</m>.

  <p>
    Note that to find the weights that make <m>\vw</m> a linear combination of the vectors 
    <m>\vv_1</m> and <m>\vv_2</m>,
    we simply solved the linear system corresponding to the augmented matrix
    <me>
      [\vv_1 \  \vv_2 \ | \ \vw]
    </me>,
    where the vectors <m>\vv_1</m>,
    <m>\vv_2</m>,
    and <m>\vw</m> form the columns of an augmented matrix,
    and the solution of the system gave us the weights of the linear combination.
    In general, if we want to find weights <m>c_1</m>,
    <m>c_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
    <m>c_m</m> so that a vector <m>\vw</m> in <m>\R^n</m> is a linear 
    combination of the vectors <m>\vv_1</m>,
    <m>\vv_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
    <m>\vv_m</m> in <m>\R^n</m>,
    we solve the system corresponding to the augmented matrix
    <me>
      [\vv_1 \  \vv_2 \  \vv_3 \ \cdots \ \vv_m | \ \vw]
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any solution to this system will gives us the weights.
    If this system has no solutions,
    then <m>\vw</m> cannot be written as a linear combination of the vectors <m>\vv_1</m>,
    <m>\vv_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\vv_m</m>.
    This shows us the equivalence of the linear system and its vector equation representation.
    Specifically, we have the following result.
  </p>

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The vector equation
        <me>
          x_1 \vv_1 + x_2\vv_2 + x_3\vv_3 + \cdots + x_m\vv_m = \vw
        </me>
        has the same solution set as the linear system represented by the augmented matrix
        <me>
          [\vv_1 \  \vv_2 \  \vv_3 \ \cdots \ \vv_m | \ \vw]
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular,
        the system has a solution if and only if <m>\vw</m> is a linear combination of the vectors 
        <m>\vv_1, \vv_2, \vv_3, \ldots, \vv_m</m>.
      </p>
