    As we will discuss, left multiplication by an
    <m>m \times n</m> matrix defines a function from <m>\R^n</m> to <m>\R^m</m>.
    Such a function defined by matrix multiplication is called a matrix transformation.
    In this section we study some of the properties of matrix transformations and understand how,
    using the pivots of the matrix,
    to determine when the output of a matrix transformation covers the whole space <m>R^m</m> or when a transformation maps distinct vectors to distinct outputs.

    Matrix transformations are used extensively in computer graphics to produce animations as seen in video games and movies.
    For example,
    consider the dancing figure at left in <xref ref="F_Rotate_dance"></xref>.
    We can identify certain control points (e.g., the point at the neck,
    where the arms join the torso,
    etc.) to mark the locations of important points.
    Using just the control points we can reconstruct the figure.
    Each control point can be represented as a vector,
    and so we can manipulate the figure by manipulating the control points with matrix transformations.
    We will explore this idea in more detail later in this section.
