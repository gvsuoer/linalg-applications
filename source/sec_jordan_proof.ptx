  <title>Proof of the Existence of the Jordan Canonical Form</title>
  <p>
    While we have constructed an algorithm to find a Jordan canonical form of a square matrix,
    we haven't yet addressed the question of whether every square matrix has a Jordan canonical form.
    We do that in this section.
  </p>
  <p>
    Consider that any vector <m>[a \ b]^{\tr}</m> in <m>\R^2</m> can be written as the sum <m>[a \ 0]^{\tr} + [0 \ b]^{\tr}</m>.
    The vector <m>[a \ 0]^{\tr}</m> is a vector in the subspace <m>W_1 = \{ [x \ 0]^{\tr} | x \in \R\} = \Span \{[1 \ 0]^{\tr}\}</m> and the vector
    <m>[0 \ b]^{\tr}</m> is in the subspace <m>W_2 = \{[0 \ y]^{\tr} | y \in \R\} = \Span\{[0 \ 1]^{\tr}</m>.
    Also notice that <m>W_1 \cap W_2 = \{\vzero\}</m>.
    We can extend this idea to <m>\R^3</m>,
    where any vector <m>[a \ b \ c]^{\tr}</m> can be written as <m>[a \ 0 \ 0]^{\tr} + [0 \ b \ 0]^{\tr} + [0 \ 0 \ c]^{\tr}</m>,
    with <m>[a \ 0 \ 0]^{\tr}</m> in <m>W_1 = \Span\{[1 \ 0 \ 0]^{\tr}</m>,
    <m>[0 \ b \ 0]^{\tr}</m> in <m>W_2 = \Span\{[0 \ 1 \ 0]^{\tr}</m>,
    and <m>[0 \ 0 \ c]^{\tr}</m> in <m>W_3 = \Span\{[0 \ 0 \ 1]^{\tr}</m>.
    In this situation we write <m>\R^2 = W_1 \oplus W_2</m> and
    <m>\R^3 = W_1 \oplus W_2 \oplus W_3</m> and say that <m>\R^2</m> is the direct sum of <m>W_1</m> and <m>W_2</m>,
    while <m>\R^3</m> is the direct sum of <m>W_1</m>,
    <m>W_2</m>, and <m>W_3</m>.

      <p>
        A vector space <m>V</m> is a <term>direct sum</term>
        of subspaces <m>V_1</m>, <m>V_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
        <m>V_m</m> if every vector <m>\vv</m> in <m>V</m> can be written uniquely as a sum
        <me>
          \vv = \vv_1+\vv_2+\vv_3+\cdots + \vv_m
        </me>,
        with <m>\vv_i \in V_i</m> for each <m>i</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    If <m>V</m> is a direct sum of subspaces <m>V_1</m>,
    <m>V_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>V_m</m>, then we write
    <me>
      V = V_1 \oplus V_2 \oplus \cdots \oplus V_m
    </me>.

    Some useful facts about direct sums are given in the following theorem.
    The proofs are left for the exercises.
