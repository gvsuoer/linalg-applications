  <title>Two Devices for Remembering Determinants</title>
  <p>
    There are useful ways to remember how to calculate the formulas for determinants of
    <m>2 \times 2</m> and <m>3 \times 3</m> matrices.
    In the <m>2 \times 2</m> case of <m>A = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} a_{11}\amp a_{12} \\ a_{21}\amp a_{22} \end{array}  \right]</m>,
    we saw that
    <me>
      |A| = a_{11}a_{22} - a_{21}a_{22}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This makes <m>|A|</m> the product of the diagonal elements <m>a_{11}</m> and <m>a_{22}</m> minus the product of the off-diagonal elements <m>a_{12}</m> and <m>a_{21}</m>.
    We can visualize this in an array by drawing arrows across the diagonal and off-diagonal,
    with a plus sign on the diagonal arrow indicting that we add the product of the diagonal elements and a minus sign on the off-diagonal arrow indicating that we subtract the product of the off-diagonal elements as shown in <xref ref="F_2by2_determinant"></xref>.

  <p>
    We can do a similar thing for the determinant of a <m>3 \times 3</m> matrix.
    In this case, we extend the <m>3 \times 3</m> array to a
    <m>3 \times 5</m> array by adjoining the first two columns onto the matrix.
    We then add the products along the diagonals going from left to right and subtract the products along the diagonals going from right to left as indicated in <xref ref="F_3by3_determinant"></xref>.
