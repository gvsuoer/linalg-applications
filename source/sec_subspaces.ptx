    <p>
      In <xref ref="sec_R_n">Section</xref>
      we saw that <m>\R^n</m> contained subsets that we called subspaces that had the same algebraic structure as <m>\R^n</m>.
      The same idea applies to vector spaces in general.

      illustrates an important point.
      There is a fundamental difference in the types of properties that define a vector space.
      Some of the properties that define a vector space are true for any subset of the vector space because they are properties of the operations
      (such as the commutative and associative properties).
      The other properties (closure,
      the inclusion of the zero vector,
      and the inclusion of additive inverses) are set properties,
      not properties of the operations.
      So these three properties have to be specifically checked to see if a subset of a vector space is also a vector space.
      This leads to the definition of a <em>subspace</em>,
      a subset of a vector space which is a vector space itself.

      There is an interesting subspace relationship between the spaces <m>\pol_1, \pol_2, \pol_3, \ldots</m> and <m>\pol</m>.
      For every <m>i</m>, <m>\pol_i</m> is a subspace of <m>\pol</m>.
      Furthermore, <m>\pol_1</m> is a subspace of <m>\pol_2</m>,
      <m>\pol_2</m> is a subspace of <m>\pol_3</m>, and so on.
      Note however that a similar relationship does NOT hold for <m>\R^n</m>,
      even though <m>\pol_i</m> looks like <m>\R^{i+1}</m>.
      For example, <m>\R^1</m> is NOT a subspace of <m>\R^2</m>.
      Similarly, <m>\R^2</m> is NOT a subspace of <m>\R^3</m>.
      Since the vectors in different <m>\R^n</m>'s are of different sizes,
      none of the <m>\R^i</m>'s is a subset of another <m>\R^n</m> with <m>i \neq n</m>,
      and hence,
      <m>\R^i</m> is not a subspace of <m>\R^n</m> when <m>i\lt n</m>.

    <title>The Subspace Spanned by a Set of Vectors</title>
    <p>
      In <m>\R^n</m> we showed that the span of any set of vectors forms a subspace of <m>\R^n</m>.
      The same is true in any vector space.
      Recall that the span of a set of vectors in <m>\R^n</m> is the set of all linear combinations of those vectors.
      So before we can discuss the span of a set of vectors in a vector space,
      we need to extend the definition of linear combinations to vector spaces
      (compare to <xref ref="x1_d_linear_combination">Definitions</xref>
      and <xref ref="def_1_d_span"></xref>).
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>V</m> be a vector space.
          A <term>linear combination</term><idx><h>linear combination of vectors in a vector space</h></idx> of vectors <m>\vv_1</m>,
          <m>\vv_2</m>,
          <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\vv_k</m> in <m>V</m> is a vector of the form
          <me>
            x_1\vv_1+x_2\vv_2 + \cdots + x_k \vv_k
          </me>,
          where <m>x_1</m>, <m>x_2</m>,
          <m>\ldots</m>, <m>x_k</m> are scalars.
          The <term>span</term><idx><h>span of a set of vectors in a vector space</h></idx> of the vectors <m>\vv_1</m>,
          <m>\vv_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
          <m>\vv_k</m> is the collection of all linear combinations of <m>\vv_1</m>,
          <m>\vv_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\vv_k</m>.
          That is,
          <me>
            \Span\{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_k\} = \{x_1\vv_1+x_2\vv_2 + \cdots + x_k \vv_k \mid x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k \text{ are scalars } \}
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The argument that the span of any finite set of vectors in a vector space forms a subspace is the same as we gave for the span of a set of vectors in <m>\R^n</m>
      (see <xref ref="thm_3_a_span_subspace">Theorem</xref>).
      The proof is left for the exercises.

      the equation

      We will see important uses of special spanning sets called bases in the rest of this chapter.
