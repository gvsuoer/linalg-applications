  <title>Orthogonal and Orthonormal Bases in Inner Product Spaces</title>
  <p>
    As we did with inner products in <m>\R^n</m>,
    we define an orthogonal set to be one in which all of the vectors in the set are orthogonal to each other
    (compare to <xref ref="def_6_b_orthogonal_set_Rn"></xref>).
  </p>

  <definition>
  <idx><h>orthogonal set in an inner product space</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A subset <m>S</m> of an inner product space for which <m>\langle \vu, \vv \rangle = 0</m> for all
        <m>\vu \neq \vv</m> in <m>S</m> is called an
        <term>orthogonal set</term>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    As in <m>\R^n</m>,
    an orthogonal set of nonzero vectors is always linearly independent.
    The proof is similar to that of <xref ref="thm_6_b_Orth_li"></xref> and is left to the exercises.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm_6_c_Orth_li_ips">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_m\}</m> be a set of nonzero orthogonal vectors in an inner product space.
        Then the vectors <m>\vv_1</m>, <m>\vv_2</m>,
        <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\vv_m</m> are linearly independent.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    A basis that is also an orthogonal set is given a special name
    (compare to <xref ref="def_6_b_orthogonal_basis_Rn"></xref>).
  </p>

  <definition>
  <idx><h>orthogonal basis in an inner product space</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        An <term>orthogonal basis</term> <m>\CB</m> for a subspace <m>W</m> of an inner product space is a basis of <m>W</m> that is also an orthogonal set.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    Using inner products in <m>\R^n</m>,
    we saw that the representation of a vector as a linear combination of vectors in an orthogonal basis was quite elegant.
    The same is true in any inner product space.
    To see this,
    let <m>\CB = \{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_m\}</m> be an orthogonal basis for a subspace <m>W</m> of an inner product space and let <m>\vx</m> be any vector in <m>W</m>.
    We know that
    <me>
      \vx = x_1\vv_1 + x_2\vv_2 + \cdots + x_m \vv_m
    </me>
    for some scalars <m>x_1</m>, <m>x_2</m>,
    <m>\ldots</m>, <m>x_m</m>.
    If <m>1\leq k\leq m</m>, then,
    using inner product properties and the orthogonality of the vectors <m>\vv_i</m>, we have
    <me>
      \langle \vv_k, \vx \rangle = x_1 \langle \vv_k, \vv_1 \rangle + x_2 \langle \vv_k, \vv_2 \rangle + \cdots + x_m \langle \vv_k, \vv_m \rangle = x_k \langle \vv_k, \vv_k \rangle
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    So
    <me>
      x_k = \ds \frac{\langle \vx, \vv_k \rangle}{\langle \vv_k,  \vv_k \rangle}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus, we can calculate each weight individually with two simple inner product calculations.
  </p>
  <p>
    We summarize this discussion in the next theorem
    (compare to <xref ref="thm_6_b_orth_dcomp"></xref>).

  <theorem xml:id="thm_6_c_orth_dcomp">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\CB = \{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_m\}</m> be an orthogonal basis for a subspace of an inner product space.
        Let <m>\vx</m> be a vector in <m>W</m>.
        Then
        <men xml:id="eq_6_c_orth_decomp_ips">
          \vx = \ds \frac{\langle \vx, \vv_1 \rangle}{\langle \vv_1, \vv_1 \rangle} \vv_1 +  \frac{\langle \vx, \vv_2 \rangle}{\langle \vv_2, \vv_2 \rangle} \vv_2 + \cdots + \frac{\langle \vx, \vv_m \rangle}{\langle \vv_m, \vv_m \rangle} \vv_m
        </men>.

    <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>p_1(t) = 1-t</m>, <m>p_2(t) = -2+4t+4t^2</m>,
      and <m>p_3(t) = 7-41t+40t^2</m> be vectors in the inner product space <m>\pol_2</m> with inner product defined by <m>\langle p(t),
      q(t) \rangle = \int_0^1 p(t)q(t) \ dt</m>.
      Let <m>\CB = \{p_1(t), p_2(t), p_3(t)\}</m>.
      You may assume that <m>\CB</m> is an orthogonal basis for <m>\pol_2</m>.
      Let <m>z(t) = 4-2t^2</m>.
      Find the weight <m>x_3</m> so that <m>z(t) = x_1p_1(t) + x_2 p_2(t) + x_3 p_3(t)</m>.
      Use technology as appropriate to evaluate any integrals.

  <p>
    The decomposition <xref ref="eq_6_c_orth_decomp_ips"/> is even simpler if <m>\langle \vv_k, \vv_k \rangle = 1</m> for each <m>k</m>.
    Recall that
    <me>
      \langle \vv, \vv \rangle = || \vv ||^2
    </me>,
    so the condition <m>\langle \vv, \vv \rangle  = 1</m> implies that the vector <m>\vv</m> has norm 1.
    As with inner products in <m>\R^n</m>,
    an orthogonal basis with this additional condition is given a special name
    (compare to <xref ref="def_6_b_orthonormal_basis"></xref>).

  <p>
    If <m>\CB = \{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_m\}</m> is an orthonormal basis for a subspace <m>W</m> of an inner product space and <m>\vx</m> is a vector in <m>W</m>,
    then <xref ref="eq_6_c_orth_decomp_ips"/> becomes
    <men xml:id="eq_6_c_orthnorm_decomp_ips">
      \vx = \langle \vx, \vv_1 \rangle \vv_1 +  \langle \vx, \vv_2 \rangle \vv_2 + \cdots + \langle \vx, \vv_m \rangle \vv_m

  </p>
  <p>
    Recall that we can construct an orthonormal basis from an orthogonal basis by dividing each basis vector by its magnitude.
