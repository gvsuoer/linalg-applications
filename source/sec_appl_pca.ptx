  <title>Application: Principal Component Analysis</title>
  <p>
    The discipline of statistics is based on the idea of analyzing data.
    In large data sets it is usually the case that one wants to understand the relationships between the different data in the set.
    This can be difficult to do when the data set is large and it is impossible to visually examine the data for patterns.
    Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a tool for identifying and representing underlying patterns in large data sets,
    and PCA has been called one of the most important and valuable linear algebra tools for statistical analysis.
    PCA is used to transform a collection of variables into a
    (usually smaller)
    number of uncorrelated variables called principal components.
    The principal components form the most meaningful basis from which to view data by removing extraneous information and revealing underlying relationships in the data.
    This presents a framework for how to reduce a complex data set to a lower dimension while retaining the important attributes of the data set.
    The output helps the experimenter determine which dynamics in the data are important and which can be ignored.
