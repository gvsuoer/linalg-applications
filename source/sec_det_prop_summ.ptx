        The elementary row operations have the following effects on the determinant:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              If we multiply a row of a matrix by a constant <m>k</m>,
              then the determinant is multiplied by <m>k</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If we swap two rows of a matrix,
              then the determinant changes sign.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If we add a multiple of a row of a matrix to another,
              the determinant does not change.
            </p>

        Each of the elementary row operations can be achieved by multiplication by elementary matrices.
        To obtain the elementary matrix corresponding to an elementary row operation,
        we perform the operation on the identity matrix.

        Let <m>A</m> be an <m>n\times n</m> invertible matrix.
        For any <m>\vb</m> in <m>\R^n</m>,
        the solution <m>\vx</m> of <m>A\vx=\vb</m> has entries
        <me>
          x_i =\frac{\det(A_i(\vb))}{\det(A)}
        </me>
        where <m>A_i(\vb)</m> represents the matrix formed by replacing <m>i</m>th column of <m>A</m> with <m>\vb</m>.

        Let <m>A</m> be an invertible <m>n\times n</m> matrix.
        Then
        <me>
          A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det(A)} \text{ adj }  A
        </me>
        where the <m>\text{ adj }  A</m> matrix,
        the <em>adjugate of <m>A</m></em>,
        is defined as the matrix whose <m>ij</m>-th entry is <m>C_{ji}</m>,
        the <m>ji</m>-th cofactor of <m>A</m>.

        For a <m>2\times 2</m> matrix <m>A</m>,
        the area of the image of the unit square under the transformation
        <m>T(\vx)=A\vx</m> is equal to <m>|\det(A)|</m>,
        which is also equal to the area of the parallelogram defined by the columns of <m>A</m>.

      <p>
        For a <m>3\times 3</m> matrix <m>A</m>,
        the volume of the image of the unit cube under the transformation
        <m>T(\vx)=A\vx</m> is equal to <m>|\det(A)|</m>,
        which is also equal to the volume of the parallelepiped defined by the columns of <m>A</m>.

        An <m>LU</m> factorization of a square matrix <m>A</m> consists of a lower triangular matrix <m>L</m> and an upper triangular matrix <m>U</m> so that <m>A = LU</m>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A square matrix <m>A</m> has an <m>LU</m> factorization if we can use row operations without row interchanges to row reduce <m>A</m> to an upper triangular matrix <m>U</m>.
        In this situation the elementary matrices that perform the row operations produce a lower triangular matrix <m>L</m> so that <m>A = LU</m>.
        If <m>A</m> cannot be reduced to an upper triangular matrix <m>U</m> without row interchanges,
        then we can factor <m>A</m> in the form <m>PLU</m>,
        where <m>L</m> is a lower triangular matrix,
        <m>U</m> is an upper triangular matrix,
        and <m>P</m> is obtained from the identity matrix by appropriate row interchanges.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        There are many instances where we have a number of systems to solve of the form <m>A \vx = \vb</m>,
        all with the same coefficient matrix but where the vectors <m>\vb</m> can change.
        With an <m>LU</m> factorization,
        we can keep track of the row operations in one row reduction and save ourselves a significant amount of time when solving these systems.
