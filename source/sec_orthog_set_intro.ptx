    If <m>\CB = \{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_m\}</m> is a basis for a subspace <m>W</m> of <m>\R^n</m>,
    we know that any vector <m>\vw</m> in <m>W</m> can be written uniquely as a linear combination of the vectors in <m>\CB</m>.
    In the past,
    the way we have found the coordinates of <m>\vx</m> with respect to <m>\CB</m>,
    i.e. the weights needed to write a vector <m>\vx</m> as a linear combination of the elements in <m>\CB</m>,
    has been to row reduce the matrix
    <m>[\vv_1 \ \vv_2 \ \cdots \ \vv_m \ | \ \vx]</m> to solve the corresponding system.
    This can be a cumbersome process,
    especially if we need to do it many times.
    This process also forces us to determine all of the weights at once.
    For certain types of bases,
    namely the <term>orthogonal</term> and
    <term>orthonormal</term> bases,
    there is a much easier way to find individual weights for this linear combination.

    Recall that two nonzero vectors <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> in <m>\R^n</m> are orthogonal if <m>\vu \cdot \vv = 0</m>.
    We can extend this idea to an entire set.
    For example, the standard basis
    <m>\CS = \{\ve_1, \ve_2, \ve_3\}</m> for <m>\R^3</m> has the property that any two distinct vectors in <m>\CS</m> are orthogonal to each other.
    The basis vectors in <m>\CS</m> make a very nice coordinate system for <m>\R^3</m>,
    where the basis vectors provide the directions for the coordinate axes.
    We could rotate this standard basis,
    or multiply any of the vectors in the basis by a nonzero constant,
    and retain a basis in which all distinct vectors are orthogonal to each other (e.g., <m>\{[2 \ 0 \ 0]^{\tr}, [0 \ 3 \ 0]^{\tr}, [0 \ 0 \ 1]^{\tr}\}</m>).
    We define this idea of having all vectors be orthogonal to each other for sets,
    and then for bases.

                  Then determine <m>x_2</m> and <m>x_3</m> similarly.
