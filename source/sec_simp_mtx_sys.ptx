  <title>Simplifying Linear Systems Represented in Matrix Form</title>
  <p>
    Once we have stored the information about a linear system in an augmented matrix,
    we can perform the elementary operations directly on the augmented matrix.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recall that the allowable operations on a system of equations are the following:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Replacing one equation by the sum of that equation and a scalar multiple of another equation.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Interchanging the positions of two equations.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Replacing an equation by a nonzero scalar multiple of itself.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
  <idx><h>row operations</h></idx>
    Recall that we use these elementary operations to transform a system,
    with the ultimate goal of finding a simpler,
    equivalent system that we can solve.
    Since each row of an augmented matrix corresponds to an equation,
    we can translate these operations on equations to corresponding operations on rows 
    (called <term>row operations</term>
    or <term>elementary row operations</term>):
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Replacing one row by the sum of that row and a scalar multiple of another row.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Interchanging two rows.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Replacing a row by a nonzero scalar multiple of itself.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

            As a first step in solving our system,
            we might eliminate <m>a_2</m> from the second equation.
            This means that the corresponding entry in the second row and first column of the 
            augmented matrix will become 0.
            Find a row operation that adds a multiple of the first row to the second row to achieve 
            this goal.
            Then write the system of equations that corresponds to this new augmented matrix.

            Now that we have eliminated the <m>a_2</m> terms from the second equation,
            we eliminate the <m>a_2</m> term from the third equation.
            Find an appropriate row operation that does that,
            and write the corresponding system of linear equations that corresponds to the new 
            augmented matrix.

            Now you should have a system in which the last two rows correspond to a system of 2 
            linear equations in two unknowns.
            Use a row operation that adds a multiple of the second row to the third row to turn the 
            coefficient of <m>a_1</m> in the third row to 0.
            Then write the corresponding system of linear equations.

            Your simplified system and its augment matrix are in

            and this system is solvable using
            <term>back-substitution</term>
            (substituting the known variable values into the previous equation to find the value 
            of another variable).
            Solve the system.

  <remark>
  <p>
    Do you see how this standard elimination process can be generalized to any linear system with 
    any number of variables to produce a simplified system?
    Do you see why the process does not change the solutions of the system?
    If needed, can you modify the standard elimination process to obtain a simplified system in which 
    the last equation contains only the variable <m>a_2</m>,
    the next to last equation contains only the variables <m>a_1, a_2</m>,
    etc.? Understanding the standard process will enable you to be able to modify it,
    if needed, in a problem.

    illustrates how we can perform all of the operations on equations with operations on the rows of 
    augmented matrices to reduce a system to a solvable form.
    Each time we perform an operation on the system of equations
    (or on the rows of an augmented matrix)
    we obtain an equivalent system
    (or an augmented matrix corresponding to an equivalent system).
    For completeness,
    we list the operations on equations and the corresponding row operations below that can be used 
    to solve our polynomial fitting system.
    Throughout the process we will let <m>E_1</m>, <m>E_2</m>,
    and <m>E_3</m> be the first, second,
    and third equations in the system and <m>R_1</m>, <m>R_2</m>,
    and <m>R_3</m> the first, second,
    and third rows of the augmented matrices.
    The notation <m>E_1+E_2</m> placed next to equation <m>E_2</m> means means that we replace the 
    second equation in the system with the sum of the first two equations.
    We start with the system

    operations on rows of the augmented matrix.

    Now we can solve the last equation for <m>a_0</m> to find that <m>a_0=5</m>.
    The second equation gives us <m>a_1 = 2</m>.<fn>
    If there had been an <m>a_0</m> term in the second equation,
    we could have substituted <m>a_0=5</m> and solved for <m>a_1</m>
    </fn> Finally,
    using the first equation with the already determined values of <m>a_0</m> and <m>a_1</m> gives 
    us <m>a_2=-1</m>.
    Thus we have found the solution to the polynomial fitting system to be <m>a_2=-1</m>,
    <m>a_1=2</m>, and <m>a_0=5</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We summarize the steps of the (partial) elimination on matrices we used above to solve a general 
    linear system in the variables <m>x_1</m>,
    <m>x_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>x_n</m>.

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Interchange equations if needed to ensure that the coefficient of <m>x_1</m> (or,
          more generally,
          the first non-zero variable) in the first equation is non-zero.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Use the first equation to eliminate <m>x_1</m> (or,
          the first non-zero variable) from other equations by adding a multiple of the first equation to the others.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          After <m>x_1</m> is eliminated from all equations but the first equation,
          focus on the rest of the equations.
          Repeat the process of elimination on these equations to eliminate <m>x_2</m> (or,
          the next non-zero variable) all but the second equation.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Once the process of eliminating variables recursively is finished,
          solve for the variables in a backwards fashion starting with the last equation and substituting known values in the equations above as they become known.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p>
    <idx><h>forward elimination</h></idx>
    <idx><h>back substitution</h></idx>
    This elimination method where the variables are eliminated from lower equations is called the
    <term>forward elimination phase</term>
    as it eliminates variables in the forward direction.
    Solving for variables using substitution into upper equations is called
    <term>back substitution</term>.
    The matrix representation of a linear system after the forward elimination process is said to be in
    <term>row echelon form</term>.
    We will define this form and the elimination process on the matrices more precisely in the next 
    section.
