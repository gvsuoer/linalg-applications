  <title>Similar Matrices</title>
  <p>
    Similar matrices play an important role in certain calculations.
    For example, <xref ref="act_4_c_0_5"></xref>
    showed that if we can write a square matrix <m>A</m> in the form
    <m>A = P^{-1}DP</m> for some invertible matrix <m>P</m> and diagonal matrix <m>D</m>,
    then finding the powers of <m>A</m> is straightforward.
    As we will see, the relation
    <m>A = P^{-1}DP</m> will imply that the matrices <m>A</m> and <m>D</m> share many properties.

    suggests that similar matrices share some, but not all,
    properties.
    Note that if <m>A = P^{-1}BP</m>,
    then <m>B = Q^{-1}AQ</m> with <m>Q = P^{-1}</m>.
    So if <m>A</m> is similar to <m>B</m>,
    then <m>B</m> is similar to <m>A</m>.
    Similarly (no pun intended), since <m>A = I^{-1}AI</m>
    (where <m>I</m> is the identity matrix),
    then any square matrix is similar to itself.
    Also, if <m>A = P^{-1}BP</m> and <m>B = M^{-1}CM</m>,
    then <m>A = (MP)^{-1}C(MP)</m>.
    So if <m>A</m> is similar to <m>B</m> and <m>B</m> is similar to <m>C</m>,
    then <m>A</m> is similar to <m>C</m>.
    If you have studied relations,
    these three properties show that similarity is an equivalence relation on the set of all <m>n \times n</m> matrices.
    This is one reason why similar matrices share many important traits,
    as the next activity highlights.

            Use the multiplicative property of the determinant to explain why <m>\det(A) = \det(B)</m>.
            So similar matrices have the same determinants.
