  <title>Conditions for a Basis of a Subspace of <m>\R^n</m></title>
  <p>
    There are two items we need to confirm before we can state that a subset <m>\B</m> of a subspace <m>W</m> of <m>\R^n</m> is a basis for <m>W</m>:
    the set <m>\B</m> must be linearly independent and span <m>W</m>.
    However, if we have the right number (namely,
    the dimension) of vectors in our set <m>\B</m>,
    then either one of these conditions will imply the other.

      Let <m>W</m> be a subspace of <m>\R^n</m> with <m>\dim(W) = k</m>.
      We know that every basis of <m>W</m> contains exactly <m>k</m> vectors.

            Suppose that <m>S</m> is a subset of <m>W</m> that contains <m>k</m> vectors and is linearly independent.
            In this part of the activity we will show that <m>S</m> must span <m>W</m>.

                  Suppose that <m>S</m> does not span <m>W</m>.
                  Explain why this implies that <m>W</m> contains a set of <m>k+1</m> linearly independent vectors.
