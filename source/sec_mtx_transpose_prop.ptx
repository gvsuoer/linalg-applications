  <title>Properties of the Matrix Transpose</title>
  <p>
    As with every other operation,
    we want to understand what properties the matrix transpose has.
    Properties of transposes are shown in the following theorem.
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="thm_transpose_props">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be matrices of the appropriate sizes and let
         <m>a</m> be a scalar.
        Then
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\left(A^{\tr}\right)^{\tr} = A</m>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>(A+B)^{\tr} = A^{\tr} + B^{\tr}</m>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>(AB)^{\tr} = B^{\tr}A^{\tr}</m>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>(aA)^{\tr} = aA^{\tr}</m>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    The one property that might seem strange is the third one.
    To understand this property,
    suppose <m>A</m> is an <m>m \times n</m> matrix and <m>B</m> an
    <m>n \times k</m> matrix so that the product <m>AB</m> is defined.
    We will argue that <m>(AB)^{\tr} = B^{\tr}A^{\tr}</m> by comparing the 
    <m>i,j</m>th entry of each side.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          First notice that the <m>i,j</m>th entry of
          <m>(AB)^{\tr}</m> is the <m>j,i</m>th entry of <m>AB</m>.
          The <m>j,i</m>th entry of <m>AB</m> is found by taking the scalar
           product of the <m>j</m>th row of <m>A</m> with the <m>i</m>th column of <m>B</m>.
          Thus, the <m>i,j</m>th entry of
          <m>(AB)^{\tr}</m> is the scalar product of the <m>j</m>th row of 
          <m>A</m> with the <m>i</m>th column of <m>B</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <m>i,j</m>th entry of <m>B^{\tr}A^{\tr}</m> is the scalar product 
          of the <m>i</m>th row of <m>B^{\tr}</m> with the <m>j</m>th column of <m>A^{\tr}</m>.
          But the <m>i</m>th row of <m>B^{\tr}</m> is the <m>i</m>th column of 
          <m>B</m> and the <m>j</m>th column of <m>A^{\tr}</m> is the <m>j</m>th row of <m>A</m>.
          So the <m>i,j</m>th entry of
          <m>B^{\tr}A^{\tr}</m> is the scalar product of the <m>j</m>th row of 
          <m>A</m> with the <m>i</m>th column of <m>B</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Since the two matrices <m>(AB)^{\tr}</m> and
    <m>B^{\tr}A^{\tr}</m> have the same size and same corresponding entries,
    they are the same matrix.
