  <title>Project: Modeling Population Migration</title>
  <p>
    As introduced earlier,
    data from the Michigan Department of Technology, Management,
    and Budget shows that from 2011 to 2012,
    approximately 0.05% of the U.S. population outside of Michigan moved to the state of Michigan,
    while approximately 2% of Michigan's population moved out of Michigan.
    We are interested in determining the long-term distribution of population in Michigan.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let <m>\vx_n = \left[ \begin{array}{c} m_n \\ u_n \end{array} \right]</m> be the
    <m>2 \times 1</m> vector where <m>m_n</m> is the population of Michigan and <m>u_n</m> is the U.S. population outside of Michigan in year <m>n</m>.
    Assume that we start our analysis at generation 0 and <m>\vx_0 = \left[ \begin{array}{c} m_0 \\ u_0 \end{array} \right]</m>.

            Explain how the data above shows that
            <md>
              <mrow>m_1 \amp = 0.98m_0 + 0.0005u_0</mrow>
              <mrow>u_1 \amp = 0.02m_0 + 0.9995u_0</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>
        </statement>
      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Identify the matrix <m>A</m> such that <m>\vx_1 = A \vx_{0}</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </task>
    
  </project>

  <p>
    One we have the equation <m>\vx_1 = A\vx_0</m>,
    we can extend it to subsequent years:
    <me>
      \vx_2 = A\vx_1, \ \ \ \ \vx_3 = A \vx_2, \ \ \ \ , ..., \ \ \ \ \vx_{n+1} = A \vx_n
    </me>
    for each <m>n \geq 0</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This example illustrates the general nature of what is called a <em>Markov process</em>
    (see <xref ref="def_Markov"></xref>).
    Recall that the matrix <m>A</m> that provides the link from one generation to the next is called the transition matrix.
  </p>
  <p>
    In situations like these,
    we are interested in determining if there is a steady-state vector,
    that is a vector that satisfies
    <men xml:id="eq_Mi_pop_2">
      \vx = A \vx
    </men>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Such a vector would show us the long-term population of Michigan provided the population dynamics do not change.

        <statement>
          <p>
            Explain why a steady-state solution to <xref ref="eq_Mi_pop_2"/> is an eigenvector of <m>A</m>.
            What is the corresponding eigenvalue?
          </p>
        </statement>
      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Consider again the transition matrix <m>A</m> from <xref ref="act_Mi_pop_1"></xref>.
            Recall that the solutions to equation <xref ref="eq_Mi_pop_2"/> are all the vectors in <m>\Nul (A-I_2)</m>.
            In other words,
            the eigenvectors of <m>A</m> for this eigenvalue are the nonzero vectors in <m>\Nul (A-I_2)</m>.
            Find a basis for the eigenspace of <m>A</m> corresponding to this eigenvalue.
            Use whatever technology is appropriate.

      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Once we know a basis for the eigenspace of the transition matrix <m>A</m>,
            we can use it to estimate the steady-state population of Michigan
            (assuming the stated migration trends are valid long-term).
            According to the <url href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-national-total.html" visual="census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-national-total.html">US Census Bureau</url>,
            the resident US population on December 1, 2019 was 330,073,471.
            Assuming no population growth in the U.S., what would the long-term population of Michigan be?
            How realistic do you think this is?
