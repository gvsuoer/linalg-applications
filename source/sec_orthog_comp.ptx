    In <xref ref="act_6_a_orthogonality"></xref>
    we defined two vectors <m>\vu</m> and <m>\vv</m> in <m>\R^n</m> to be orthogonal
    (or perpendicular)
    if <m>\vu \cdot \vv = 0</m>.
    A use of orthogonality in geometry is to define a plane.
    A plane through the origin in <m>\R^3</m> is a two dimensional subspace of <m>\R^3</m>,
    and a plane is defined to be the set of all vectors in <m>\R^3</m> that are orthogonal to a given vector
    (called a <term>normal</term>
    vector).
    For example,
    to find the equation of the plane through the origin in <m>\R^3</m> orthogonal to the normal vector <m>\vn = [1 \ 2 \ -1]^{\tr}</m>,
    we seek all the vectors <m>\vv = [x \  y \ z]^{\tr}</m> such that
    <me>
      \vv \cdot \vn = \vzero
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This gives us the equation
    <me>
      x+2y-z = 0
    </me>
    as the equation of this plane.
    The collection of all vectors that are orthogonal to a given subspace of vectors is called the
    <term>orthogonal complement</term>
    of that subspace in <m>\R^n</m>.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def_6_a_orth_complement">
  <idx><h>orthogonal complement</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>W</m> be a subspace of <m>\R^n</m> for some <m>n \geq 1</m>.
        The <term>orthogonal complement</term>
        of <m>W</m> is the set
        <me>
          W^{\perp} = \{\vx \in \R^n : \vx \cdot \vw = 0 \text{ for all }  \vw \in W\}
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <exploration xml:id="pa_6_a_2">
    <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>W = \Span\{[1 \ -1]^{\tr}\}</m> in <m>\R^2</m>.
      Completely describe all vectors in
      <m>W^{\perp}</m> both algebraically and geometrically.
    </p>
    </statement>
  </exploration>

  <p>
    There is a more general idea here as defined in <xref ref="pa_6_a_2"></xref>.
    If we have a set <m>S</m> of vectors in <m>\R^n</m>, we let <m>S^{\perp}</m>
    (read as
    <q><m>S</m> perp</q>, called the <term>orthogonal complement</term> of <m>S</m>)
    be the set of all vectors in <m>\R^n</m> that are orthogonal to every vector in <m>S</m>.
    In our plane example, the set <m>S</m> is <m>\{\vn\}</m> and
    <m>S^{\perp}</m> is the plane with equation <m>x+2y-z=0</m>.

    <introduction>
    <p>
      We have seen another example of orthogonal complements.
      Let <m>A</m> be an <m>m \times n</m> matrix with rows <m>\vr_1</m>,
      <m>\vr_2</m> , <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\vr_m</m> in order.
      Consider the three spaces <m>\Nul A</m>, <m>\Row A</m>,
      and <m>\Col A</m> related to <m>A</m>,
      where <m>\Row A = \Span\{\vr_1, \vr_2, \ldots, \vr_m\}</m>
      (that is, <m>\Row A</m> is the span of the rows of <m>A</m>).
      Let <m>\vx</m> be a vector in <m>\Row A</m>.
    </p>
    </introduction>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            What does it mean for <m>\vx</m> to be in <m>\Row A</m>?

      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Now let <m>\vy</m> be a vector in <m>\Nul A</m>.
            Use the result of part (a) and the fact that
            <m>A \vy = \vzero</m> to explain why <m>\vx \cdot \vy = 0</m>.
            Explain how this verifies <m>(\Row A)^{\perp} = \Nul A</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            Calculate <m>A \vy</m> using scalar products of rows of <m>A</m> with <m>\vy</m>.
          </p>
        </hint>
      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Use <m>A^\tr</m> in place of <m>A</m> in the result of the previous part to show <m>(\Col A)^{\perp} = \Nul A^{\tr}</m>.
          </p>

    The activity proves the following theorem:
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm_6_a_orthogonal_subspaces">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be an <m>m \times n</m> matrix.
        Then
        <me>
          (\Row A)^{\perp} = \Nul A \text{ and }  (\Col A)^{\perp} = \Nul A^{\tr}
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    To show that a vector is in the orthogonal complement of a subspace,
    it is not necessary to demonstrate that the vector is orthogonal to every vector in the subspace.
    If we have a basis for the subspace,
    it suffices to show that the vector is orthogonal to every vector in that basis for the subspace,
    as the next theorem demonstrates.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm_6_a_dot_pd_orth_complement_basis">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\CB = \{\vw_1, \vw_2, \ldots, \vw_m\}</m> be a basis for a subspace <m>W</m> of <m>\R^n</m>.
        A vector <m>\vv</m> in <m>\R^n</m> is orthogonal to every vector in <m>W</m> if and only if <m>\vv</m> is orthogonal to every vector in <m>\CB</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>\CB = \{\vw_1, \vw_2, \ldots, \vw_m\}</m> be a basis for a subspace <m>W</m> of <m>\R^n</m> and let <m>\vv</m> be a vector in <m>\R^n</m>.
      Our theorem is a biconditional,
      so we need to prove both implications.
      Since <m>\CB \subset W</m>,
      it follows that if <m>\vv</m> is orthogonal to every vector in <m>W</m>,
      then <m>\vv</m> is orthogonal to every vector in <m>\CB</m>.
      This proves the forward implication.
      Now we assume that <m>\vv</m> is orthogonal to every vector in <m>\CB</m> and show that <m>\vv</m> is orthogonal to every vector in <m>W</m>.
      Let <m>\vx</m> be a vector in <m>W</m>.
      Then
      <me>
        \vx = x_1\vw_1 + x_2\vw_2 + \cdots + x_m\vw_m
      </me>
      for some scalars <m>x_1</m>, <m>x_2</m>,
      <m>\ldots</m>, <m>x_m</m>.
      Then
      <md>
        <mrow>\vv \cdot \vx \amp = \vv \cdot (x_1\vw_1 + x_2\vw_2 + \cdots + x_m\vw_m)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = x_1(\vv \cdot \vw_1) + x_2(\vv \cdot \vw_2) + \cdots + x_m(\vv \cdot \vw_m)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = 0</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, <m>\vv</m> is orthogonal to <m>\vx</m> and <m>\vv</m> is orthogonal to every vector in <m>W</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>
  </theorem>

      Let <m>W = \Span\left\{ \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{array} \right], \left[ \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{array} \right] \right\}</m>.
      Find all vectors in <m>W^{\perp}</m>.
