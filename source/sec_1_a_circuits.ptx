    Mathematical modeling,
    or the act of creating equations to model given information,
    is an important part of problem solving.
    In this section we will see how we derived the system of equations

    to represent the electrical current in the circuit shown in <xref ref="F_circuit1"></xref>.
    Recall that a circuit consists of
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          one or more electrical sources
          (like a battery),
          denoted by <image width="40%" source="1_a_pa_source"/>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          one or more resistors
          (like any appliance that you plug into a wall outlet),
          denoted by <image width="40%" source="1_a_pa_resistor"/> .
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    The source creates a charge that produces potential energy <m>E</m> measured in volts (V).
    No substance conducts electricity perfectly,
    there is always some price to pay
    (energy loss)
    to moving electricity.
    Electrical current <m>I</m> in amperes (A) is the flow of the electric charge in the circuit. (A current of 1 ampere means that
    <m>6.2 \times 10^{18}</m> electrons pass through the circuit per second.) Current flows out of the positive terminal of a source and runs through each branch of the circuit.
    Let <m>I_1</m> be the current flowing through the upper branch,
    <m>I_2</m> the current through middle branch,
    and <m>I_3</m> the current through the lower branch as illustrated in <xref ref="F_circuit1"></xref>.
    The goal is to find the current flowing in each branch of the circuit.
  </p>
  <p>
    Linear algebra comes into play when analyzing a circuit based on the relationship between current,
    resistance, and potential.
    Three basic principles govern current low in a circuit.
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Resistance <m>R</m> in ohms (<m>\Omega</m>) can be thought of as a measure of how difficult 
          it is to move a charge along a circuit.
          When a current flows through a resistor,
          it must expend some energy, called a <em>voltage drop</em>.
          Ohm's Law
          states that the voltage drop <m>E</m> across a resistor is the product of the current 
          <m>I</m> passing through the resistor and the resistance <m>R</m>.
          That is,
          <me>
            E = IR
          </me>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Kirchoff's Current Law
          states that at any point in an electrical circuit,
          the sum of currents flowing into that point is equal to the sum of currents flowing out 
          of that point.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Kirchoff's Voltage Law
          says that around any closed loop the sum of the voltage drops is equal to the sum of the voltage rises.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    To see how these laws allow us to model the circuit in <xref ref="F_circuit1"></xref>,
    we will need three equations in <m>I_1</m>, <m>I_2</m>,
    and <m>I_3</m> to determine the values of these currents.
    Let us first apply Kirchoff's Current Law to the point P. The currents flowing into point P are <m>I_1</m> and <m>I_3</m>,
    and the current flowing out is <m>I_2</m>.
    This produces the equation <m>I_1+I_3 = I_2</m>, or
    <me>
      I_1 - I_2 + I_3 = 0
    </me>.
  </p>
  <project>
    <p>
      Apply Kirchoff's Current Law to the point <m>Q</m> to obtain an equation in <m>I_1</m>,
      <m>I_2</m>, and <m>I_3</m>.
      What do you notice?
    </p>
  </project>
  <p>
    We have three variables to determine,
    so we still need two more equations in <m>I_1</m>,
    <m>I_2</m>, and <m>I_3</m>.
    Next we apply Kirchoff's Voltage Law to the top loop in the circuit in <xref ref="F_circuit1"></xref>.
    We will assume the following sign conventions:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          A current passing through a resistor produces a voltage drop if it flows in the 
          direction of loop
          (and a voltage rise if the current passes in the opposite direction of the loop).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A current passing through a source in the direction of the loop produces a voltage drop 
          if it flows from <m>+</m> to <m>-</m> and a voltage rise if it flows from <m>-</m> to <m>+</m>,
          while a current passing through a source in the opposite direction of the loop produces a 
          voltage rise if it flows from <m>+</m> to <m>-</m> and a voltage drop if it flows from <m>-</m> to <m>+</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    (The directions chosen in <xref ref="F_circuit1"></xref>
    for the voltage flow are arbitrary <mdash/> if we reverse the flow then we just replace 
    voltage drops with voltage rises and obtain the same equations.
    If a solution shows that a current is negative,
    then that current flows in the direction opposite of what is shown.)
  </p>
  <p>
    If we move in the counterclockwise direction around the top loop in the circuit in <xref ref="F_circuit1"></xref>,
    there is a voltage rise through the source of 8 volts.
    This must equal the voltage drop in this loop.
    The current <m>I_1</m> passing though the resistor of resistance 2 <m>\Omega</m> produces a voltage drop of <m>2I_1</m> volts.
    Similarly, the current <m>I_1</m> passing through the resistor of resistance
    <m>3 \Omega</m> produces a voltage drop of <m>3I_1</m> volts.
    Finally, the current <m>I_2</m> passing through the resistor of resistance 2 <m>\Omega</m> produces a voltage drop of <m>2I_2</m> volts.
    So Kirchoff's Voltage Law applied to the top loop in the circuit in <xref ref="F_circuit1"></xref>
    gives us the equation <m>2I_1 + 3I_1 + 2I_2 = 8</m> or
    <me>
      5I_1 + 2I_2 = 8
    </me>.
  </p>

  <project>
    <p>
      Apply Kirchoff's Voltage Law to the bottom loop in the circuit in <xref ref="F_circuit1"></xref>
      to obtain an equation in <m>I_1</m>,
      <m>I_2</m>, and <m>I_3</m>.
      Compare the three equations we have found to those in the introduction.

            <m>R_1=R_2=R_3=R_5= 1 \Omega</m>,

            <m>I_1</m>, <m>I_2</m>, <m>I_3</m>,
            <m>I_4</m>, and <m>I_5</m>.

                  Use Kirchoff's Current Law to show that <m>I_0 = I_1+I_2</m>,
                  <m>I_3 = I_1-I_5</m>, and <m>I_4 = I_2 + I_5</m>.
                  Thus, we reduce the problem to three variables.

            The circuit pictured in <xref ref="F_Wheatstone"></xref>
            is called a <em>Wheatstone bridge</em>
            (invented by Samuel Hunter Christie in 1833 and popularized by Sir Charles Wheatstone in 1843).
            The Wheatstone bridge is a circuit designed to determine an unknown resistance by balancing two paths in a circuit.
            It is set up so that the resistances of resistors <m>R_1</m> and <m>R_2</m> are known,
            <m>R_3</m> is a variable resistor and we want to find the resistance of <m>R_4</m>.
            The resistor <m>R_5</m> is replaced with a voltmeter,
            and the resistance of <m>R_3</m> is varied until the voltmeter reads <m>0</m>.
            This balances the circuit and tells the resistance of resistor <m>R_4</m>.
            Show that if the current <m>I_5</m> in <xref ref="F_Wheatstone"></xref> is <m>0</m>
            (so the circuit is balanced),
            then <m>R_4 = \frac{R_2R_3}{R_1}</m>
            (which is how we calculate the unknown resistance <m>R_4</m>).
            Do this in general and do not use any specific values for the resistances or the voltage.
