  <title>Equations Involving Quadratic Forms in <m>\R^2</m></title>
  <p>
    When we consider equations of the form <m>Q(\vx) = d</m>,
    where <m>Q</m> is a quadratic form in <m>\R^2</m> and <m>d</m> is a constant,
    we wind up with old friends like <m>x^2+y^2=1</m>,
    <m>2x^2+3y^2=2</m>, or <m>x^2-y^2=1</m>.
    As we saw in <xref ref="pa_7_b"></xref>
    these equations are relatively easy to recognize.
    However, when we have cross-product terms,
    like in <m>x^2-xy+y^2=1</m>,
    it is not so easy to identify the curve the equation represents.
    If there was a way to eliminate the cross-product term <m>xy</m> from this form,
    we might be more easily able to recognize its graph.
    The discussion in this section will focus on quadratic forms in <m>\R^2</m>,
    but we will see later that the arguments work in any number of dimensions.
    While working in <m>\R^2</m> we will use the standard variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> instead of <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In general, the equation of the form <m>Q(\vx) = d</m>,
    where <m>Q</m> is a quadratic form in <m>\R^2</m> defined by a matrix
    <m>A = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} a\amp b/2\\b/2\amp c \end{array}  \right]</m> and <m>d</m> is a constant looks like
    <me>
      ax^2+bxy+cy^2 = d
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The graph of an equation like this is either an ellipse (a circle is a special case of an ellipse),
    a hyperbola,
    two non-intersecting lines, a point, or the empty set
    (see <xref ref="ex_7_b_QF_characterization"></xref>).
    The quadratic forms do not involve linear terms,
    so we don't consider the cases of parabolas.
    One way to see into which category one of these quadratic form equations falls is to write the equation in standard form.
  </p>
  <p>
    The standard forms for quadratic equations in <m>\R^2</m> are as follows,
    where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are nonzero constants and <m>h</m> and <m>k</m> are any constants.
    <dl>
      <li>
        <title>Lines:</title>
        <p>
          <m>\ds ax^2 = 1</m> or <m>\ds ay^2=1</m> (<m>a > 0</m>)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>Ellipse:</title>
        <p>
          <m>\ds \frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1</m>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>Hyperbola:</title>
        <p>
          <m>\ds \frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1</m> or <m>\ds \frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} - \frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} = 1</m>

    <xref ref="pa_7_b"></xref>
    contains the main tool that we need to convert a quadratic form into one of these standard forms.
    By this we mean that if we have a quadratic form <m>Q</m> in the variables <m>x_1</m>,
    <m>x_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>x_n</m>,
    we want to find variables <m>y_1</m>,
    <m>y_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
    <m>y_n</m> in terms of <m>x_1</m>,
    <m>x_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
    <m>x_n</m> so that when written in terms of the variables <m>y_1</m>,
    <m>y_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
    <m>y_n</m> the quadratic form <m>Q</m> contains no cross terms.
    In other words, we want to find a vector
    <m>\vy = \left[ \begin{array}{c} y_1 \\ y_2 \\ \vdots \\ y_n \end{array} \right]</m> so that <m>Q(\vx) = \vy^{\tr} D \vy</m>,
    where <m>D</m> is a diagonal matrix.
    Since every real symmetric matrix is orthogonally diagonalizable,
    we will always be able to find a matrix <m>P</m> that orthogonally diagonalizes <m>A</m>.
    The details are as follows.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let <m>Q</m> be the quadratic form defined by <m>Q(\vx) = \vx^{\tr} A \vx</m>,
    where <m>A</m> is an <m>n \times n</m> symmetric matrix.
    As in <xref ref="pa_7_b"></xref>,
    the fact that <m>A</m> is symmetric means that we can find an orthogonal matrix
    <m>P = [ \vp_1 \  \vp_2 \  \vp_3 \  \cdots \  \vp_n ]</m> whose columns are orthonormal eigenvectors of <m>A</m> corresponding to eigenvalues <m>\lambda_1</m>,
    <m>\lambda_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
    <m>\lambda_n</m>, respectively.
    Letting <m>\vy = P^{\tr} \vx</m> give us <m>\vx = P\vy</m> and
    <me>
      \vx^{\tr} A \vx = (P\vy)^{\tr}A(P\vy) = \vy^{\tr}(P^{\tr}AP)\vy = \vy^{\tr} D \vy
    </me>,
    where <m>D</m> is the diagonal matrix whose <m>i</m>th diagonal entry is <m>\lambda_i</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Moreover, the set <m>\B = \{\vp_1, \vp_2, \cdots, \vp_n\}</m> is an orthonormal basis for <m>\R^n</m> and so defines a coordinate system for <m>\R^n</m>.
    Note that if <m>y = [y_1 \ y_2 \ \cdots \ y_n]^{\tr}</m>, then
    <me>
      \vx = P\vy = y_1\vp_1 + y_2 \vp_2 + \cdots + y_n \vp_n
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus, the coordinate vector of <m>\vx</m> with respect to <m>\B</m> is <m>\vy</m>,
    or <m>[\vx]_{\B} = \vy</m>.
    We summarize in <xref ref="thm_7_b_Principal_Axis_Theorem"></xref>.

  <theorem xml:id="thm_7_b_Principal_Axis_Theorem">
    <title>Principal Axis Theorem</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be an <m>n \times n</m> symmetric matrix.
        There is an orthogonal change of variables
        <m>\vx = P\vy</m> so that the quadratic form <m>Q</m> defined by
        <m>Q(\vx) = \vx^{\tr} A \vx</m> is transformed into the quadratic form
        <m>\vy^{\tr} D \vy</m> where <m>D</m> is a diagonal matrix.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    The columns of the orthogonal matrix <m>P</m> in the Principal Axis Theorem form an orthogonal basis for <m>\R^n</m> and are called the <em>principal axes</em>
    for the quadratic form <m>Q</m>.
    Also, the coordinate vector of <m>\vx</m> with respect to this basis is <m>\vy</m>.

      Let <m>Q</m> be the quadratic form defined by <m>Q(\vx) = 2x^2 + 4xy + 5y^2 = \vx^{\tr} A \vx</m>,
      where <m>\vx = \left[ \begin{array}{c} x \\ y \end{array} \right]</m> and <m>A = \left[ \begin{array}{cc}2\amp 2\\2\amp 5 \end{array} \right]</m>.

        <statement>
          <p>
            The eigenvalues of <m>A</m> are <m>\lambda_1 = 6</m> and
            <m>\lambda_2=1</m> with corresponding eigenvectors
            <m>\vv_1 = [1 \ 2]^{\tr}</m> and <m>\vv_2 = [-2 \ 1]^{\tr}</m>,
            respectively.
            Find an orthogonal matrix <m>P</m> with determinant 1 that diagonalizes <m>A</m>.
            Is <m>P</m> unique?
            Explain.
            Is there a matrix without determinant 1 that orthogonally diagonalizes <m>A</m>?
            Explain.

            Use the matrix <m>P</m> to write the quadratic form without the cross-product.

            We can view <m>P</m> as a change of basis matrix from the coordinate system defined by
            <m>\vy = P^{\tr} \vx</m> to the standard coordinate system.
            In other words, in the standard <m>xy</m> coordinate system,
            the quadratic form is written as <m>\vx^{\tr}A \vx</m>,
            but in the new coordinate system defined by <m>\vy</m> the quadratic form is written as <m>(P\vy)^{\tr}A(P\vy)</m>.
            As a change of basis matrix, <m>P</m> performs a rotation.
            See if you can recall what we learned about rotation matrices and determine the angle of rotation <m>P</m> defines.
            Plot the graph of the quadratic equation
            <m>Q(\vx) = 1</m> in the new coordinate system and identify this angle on the graph.
            Interpret the result.
