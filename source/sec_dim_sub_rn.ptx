  <title>The Dimension of a Subspace of <m>\R^n</m></title>
  <p>
    In <xref ref="pa_3_d"></xref>
    we saw that a subspace of <m>\R^n</m> can have more than one basis.
    This prompts the question of how,
    if at all, are any two bases for a given space related.
    More specifically,
    is it possible to have two bases for a given subspace of <m>\R^n</m> that contain different numbers of vectors?
    As we will see the answer is no,
    which will lead us to the concept of <term>dimension</term>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let <m>W</m> be a subspace of <m>\R^n</m> that has a basis <m>\B = \{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_k\}</m> of <m>k</m> vectors.
    Since we have been calling bases minimal spanning sets,
    we should expect that any two bases for the same subspace have the same number of elements
    (otherwise one of the two bases would not be minimal).
    Our goal in this section is to prove that result <mdash/> that any other basis of <m>W</m> contains exactly <m>k</m> vectors.
    The approach will be the same as was used in <xref ref="pa_3_d"></xref>.
    We will let <m>U = \{\vu_1, \vu_2, \ldots, \vu_m\}</m> be a set of vectors in <m>W</m> with <m>m > k</m> and demonstrate that <m>U</m> is a linearly dependent set.
    To argue linear dependence, let <m>x_1</m>,
    <m>x_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>x_m</m> be scalars so that
    <men xml:id="eq_3_d_1">
      x_1 \vu_1 + x_2 \vu_2 + \cdots + x_m \vu_m = \vzero
    </men>.
  </p>
  <p>
    For each <m>i</m> there exist scalars <m>a_{ij}</m> so that
    <me>
      \vu_i = a_{1i}\vv_1 + a_{2i}\vv_2 + \cdots + a_{ki}\vv_k
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Substituting into <xref ref="eq_3_d_1"/> yields
    <mdn>
      <mrow number="no">\vzero \amp = x_1 \vu_1 + x_2 \vu_2 + \cdots + x_m \vu_m</mrow>
      <mrow number="no">\amp = x_1( a_{11}\vv_1 + a_{21}\vv_2 + \cdots + a_{k1}\vv_k ) + x_2 ( a_{12}\vv_1 + a_{22}\vv_2</mrow>
      <mrow number="no">\amp \qquad + \cdots  + a_{k2}\vv_k ) + \cdots + x_m ( a_{1m}\vv_1 + a_{2m}\vv_2 + \cdots + a_{km}\vv_k )</mrow>
      <mrow number="no">\amp = (x_1a_{11}+x_2a_{12}+x_3a_{13} + \cdots + x_ma_{1m})\vv_1</mrow>
      <mrow number="no">\amp \qquad + (x_1a_{21}+x_2a_{22}+x_3a_{23} + \cdots + x_ma_{2m})\vv_2</mrow>
      <mrow xml:id="eq_3_d_2">\amp \qquad + \cdots  + (x_1a_{k1}+x_2a_{k2}+x_3a_{k3} + \cdots + x_ma_{km})\vv_k</mrow>
    </mdn>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since <m>\B</m> is a basis, the vectors <m>\vv_1</m>, <m>\vv_2</m>,
    <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\vv_k</m> are linearly independent.
    So each coefficient in <xref ref="eq_3_d_2"/> is 0 and
    <m>\vx~=~[x_1 \ x_2 \ \cdots \ x_m]^{\tr}</m> is a solution to the homogeneous system <m>A \vx = \vzero</m>,
    where <m>A = [a_{ij}]</m>.
    Now <m>A</m> is a <m>k \times m</m> matrix with <m>m > k</m>,
    so not every column of <m>A</m> is a pivot column.
    This means that <m>A \vx = \vzero</m> has a nontrivial solution.
    It follows that the vector equation <xref ref="eq_3_d_1"/> has a nontrivial solution and so the <m>m</m> vectors <m>\vu_1</m>,
    <m>\vu_2</m>,
    <m>\ldots</m>, <m>\vu_m</m> are linearly dependent.
    We summarize this in the following theorem.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm_3_d_1">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>W</m> be a subspace of <m>\R^n</m> containing a basis with <m>k</m> vectors.
        If <m>m > k</m>,
        then any set of <m>m</m> vectors in <m>W</m> is linearly dependent.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    One consequence of <xref ref="thm_3_d_1"></xref> is that,
    in addition to being a minimal spanning set,
    a basis is also a maximal linearly independent set.

    <introduction>
    <p>
      Now let's return to the question of the number of elements in a basis for a subspace of <m>\R^n</m>.
      Recall that we are assuming that <m>W</m> has a basis
      <m>\B = \{\vv_1, \vv_2, \ldots, \vv_k\}</m> of <m>k</m> vectors in <m>\R^n</m>.
      Suppose that <m>\B'</m> is another basis for <m>W</m> containing <m>m</m> vectors.

  <p>
    The result of <xref ref="act_3_d_1"></xref>
    is summarized in the following theorem.
    Recall that the trivial space is the single element set <m>\{\vzero\}</m>.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm_3_d_basis">
    <statement>
      <p>
        If a nontrivial subspace <m>W</m> of <m>\R^n</m> has a basis of <m>k</m> vectors,
        then every basis of <m>W</m> contains exactly <m>k</m> vectors.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    This last theorem states that the number of vectors in a basis for a subspace space is a well-defined number.
    In other words, the number of vectors in a basis is an
    <term>invariant</term> of the subspace.
    This important number is given a name.
  </p>

  <definition>
    <idx><h>dimension</h><h>subspace of <m>\R^n</m></h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The <term>dimension</term> of a subspace <m>W</m> of <m>\R^n</m> is the number of vectors in a basis for <m>W</m>.
        The dimension of the trivial subspace
        <m>\{\vzero\}</m> of <m>\R^n</m> is defined to be 0.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    We denote the dimension of a subspace <m>W</m> of <m>\R^n</m> by <m>\dim(W)</m>.
    As we will see later,
    any two vector spaces of the same dimension are basically the same vector space.
    So the dimension of a vector space is an important number that essentially tells us all we need to know about the structure of the space.
