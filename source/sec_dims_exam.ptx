    <introduction>
      <p>
        Find a basis and dimension for each of the indicated subspaces of the given vector spaces.
      </p>
    </introduction>
        <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              <m>\{a+b(t+t^2) : a, b \in \R\}</m> in <m>\pol_2</m>
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              Let <m>W = \{a+b(t+t^2) : a, b \in \R\}</m>.
              Every element in <m>W</m> has the form
              <me>
                a+b(t+t^2) = a(1) + b(t+t^2)
              </me>.
              So <m>W = \Span\{1, t+t^2\}</m>.
              Since neither <m>1</m> nor <m>t+t^2</m> is a scalar multiple of the other,
              the set <m>\{1, t+t^2\}</m> is linearly independent.
              Thus, <m>\{1, t+t^2\}</m> is a basis for <m>W</m> and <m>\dim(W) = 2</m>.
            </p>
          </solution>
        </task>
        <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              <m>\Span\left\{1, \frac{1}{1+x^2}, \frac{2+x^2}{1+x^2}, \arctan(x)\right\}</m> in <m>\F</m>
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              Let <m>W = \Span\left\{1, \frac{1}{1+x^2}, \frac{2+x^2}{1+x^2}, \arctan(x)\right\}</m>.
              To find a basis for <m>W</m>,
              we find a linearly independent subset of <m>\left\{1, \frac{1}{1+x^2}, \frac{2+x^2}{1+x^2}, \arctan(x)\right\}</m>.
              Consider the equation
              <me>
                c_1 (1) + c_2\left(\frac{1}{1+x^2}\right) + c_3\left(\frac{2+x^2}{1+x^2}\right) + c_4 \arctan(x) = 0
              </me>.
              To find the weights <m>c_i</m> for which this equality of functions holds,
              we use the fact that the we must have equality for every <m>x</m>.
              So we pick four different values for <m>x</m> to obtain a linear system that we can solve for the weights.
              Evaluating both sides of the equation at <m>x=0</m>,
              <m>x=1</m>, <m>x=-1</m>, and <m>x=2</m> yields the equations

              </md>
              The reduced row echelon form of the coefficient matrix
              <me>
                \left[  \begin{array}{cccr} 1\amp 1\amp 2\amp 0 \\ 1\amp \frac{1}{2}\amp \frac{3}{2}\amp \frac{\pi}{4} \\ 1\amp \frac{1}{2}\amp \frac{3}{2}\amp -\frac{\pi}{4} \\ 1\amp \frac{1}{5}\amp \frac{6}{5}\amp \arctan(2) \end{array}  \right]
              </me>
              is <m>\left[ \begin{array}{cccc} 1\amp 0\amp 1\amp 0 \\ 0\amp 1\amp 1\amp 0 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 1 \\ 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0 \end{array}  \right]</m>.
              The general solution to this linear system is <m>c_1 = c_2 = -c_3</m> and <m>c_4 = 0</m>.
              Notice that
              <me>
                (-1)(1) + (-1)\left( \frac{1}{1+x^2}\right) + \frac{2+x^2}{1+x^2} = 0
              </me>
              or
              <me>
                \frac{2+x^2}{1+x^2} = 1 + \left( \frac{1}{1+x^2}\right)
              </me>,
              so <m>\frac{2+x^2}{1+x^2}</m> is a linear combination of the other vectors.
              The vectors corresponding to the pivot columns are linearly independent,
              so it follows that <m>1</m>,
              <m>\frac{1}{1+x^2}</m>, and
              <m>\arctan(x)</m> are linearly independent.
              We conclude that <m>\left\{1, \frac{1}{1+x^2},  \arctan(x)\right\}</m> is a basis for <m>W</m> and <m>\dim(W) = 3</m>.

        <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              <m>\{p(t) \in \pol_n : p(-t) = p(t)\}</m> in <m>\pol_4</m> (The polynomials with the property that <m>p(-t) = p(t)</m> are called
              <em>even</em> polynomials.)
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              Let <m>W = \{p(t) \in \pol_n : p(-t) = p(t)\}</m> in <m>\pol_4</m>.
              Let <m>p(t) \in W</m> and suppose that <m>p(t) = a_0 + a_1t+a_2t^2+a_3t^3+a_4t^4</m>.
              Since <m>p(-t)=p(t)</m>,
              we must have <m>p(1) = p(-1)</m> and <m>p(3) = p(-3)</m>.
              Since <m>p(1) = p(-1)</m>, it follows that
              <me>
                a_0+a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4 = a_0-a_1+a_2-a_3+a_4
              </me>
              or
              <me>
                a_1+a_3 = 0
              </me>.
              Similarly, the fact that <m>p(3) = p(-3)</m> yields the equation
              <me>
                a_0+3a_1+9a_2+27a_3+81a_4 = a_0-3a_1+9a_2-27a_3+81a_4
              </me>
              or
              <me>
                a_1+9a_3 = 0
              </me>.
              The reduced row echelon form of the coefficient matrix of system
              <m>a_1+a_3 = 0</m> and <m>a_1+9a_3 = 0</m> is <m>I_2</m>,
              so it follows that <m>a_1=a_3=0</m>.
              Thus, <m>p(t) = a_0 + a_2t^2+a_4t^4</m> and so <m>W = \Span\{1, t^2, t^4\}</m>.
              Equating like terms in the equation
              <me>
                c_1(1) + c_2(t^2) + c_3(t^4) = 0
              </me>
              yields <m>c_1=c_2=c_3=0</m>.
              We conclude that <m>\{1,t^2,t^4\}</m> is linearly independent and is therefore a basis for <m>W</m>.
              Thus, <m>\dim(W) = 3</m>.
              As an alternative solution, notice that <m>p(t) = t</m> is not in <m>W</m>.
              So <m>W \neq V</m> and we know that <m>\dim(W) \lt  \dim(V)</m>.
              Since <m>1</m>, <m>t^2</m>,
              and <m>t^4</m> are in <m>W</m>,
              we can show as above that <m>1</m>,
              <m>t^2</m>, and <m>t^4</m> are linearly independent.
              We can conclude that <m>\dim(W)=3</m> since it cannot be <m>4</m>.

  <example>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Let <m>U_{n \times n}</m> be the set of all
        <m>n \times n</m> upper triangular matrices.
        Recall that a matrix <m>A = [a_{ij}]</m> is upper triangular if
        <m>a_{ij} = 0</m> whenever <m>i > j</m>.
        That is, a matrix is upper triangular if all entries below the diagonal are 0.
      </p>
    </introduction>
        <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Show that <m>U_{n \times n}</m> is a subspace of <m>\M_{n \times n}</m>.
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              Since the <m>n \times n</m> zero matrix
              <m>0_{n \times n}</m> has all entries equal to 0, it follows that
              <m>0_{n \times n}</m> is in <m>U_{n \times n}</m>.
              Let <m>A = [a_{ij}]</m> and
              <m>B = [b_{ij}]</m> be in <m>U_{n \times n}</m>,
              and let <m>C = [c_{ij}] = A+B</m>.
              Then <m>c_{ij} = a_{ij} + b_{ij} = 0 + 0</m> when <m>i > j</m>.
              So <m>C</m> is an upper triangular matrix and
              <m>U_{n \times n}</m> is closed under addition.
              Let <m>c</m> be a scalar.
              The <m>ij</m>th entry of <m>cA</m> is
              <m>ca_{ij} = c(0) = 0</m> whenever <m>i > j</m>.
              So <m>cA</m> is an upper triangular matrix and
              <m>U_{n \times n}</m> is closed under multiplication by scalars.
              We conclude that <m>U_{n \times n}</m> is a subspace of <m>\M_{n \times n}</m>.

          <statement>
            <p>
              Find the dimensions of <m>U_{2 \times 2}</m> and <m>U_{3 \times 3}</m>.
              Explain.
              Make a conjecture as to what
              <m>\dim(U_{n \times n})</m> is in terms of <m>n</m>.
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              Let <m>M_{11} = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 1\amp 0 \\ 0\amp 0 \end{array}  \right]</m>,
              <m>M_{12} = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 0\amp 1 \\ 0\amp 0 \end{array}  \right]</m>,
              and <m>M_{22}=\left[ \begin{array}{cc} 0\amp 0 \\ 0\amp 1 \end{array}  \right]</m>.
              We will show that <m>S = \{M_{11}, M_{12}, M_{22}\}</m> is a basis for <m>U_{2 \times 2}</m>.
              Consider the equation
              <me>
                x_1M_{11} + x_2M_{12} + x_3 M_{22} = 0
              </me>.
              Equating like entries shows that <m>x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 0</m>,
              and so <m>S</m> is linearly independent.
              If <m>\left[ \begin{array}{cc} a\amp b \\ 0\amp c \end{array}  \right]</m> is in <m>U_{2 \times 2}</m>, then
              <me>
                \left[ \begin{array}{cc} a\amp b \\ 0\amp c \end{array}  \right] = aM_{11} + bM_{12} + cM_{22}
              </me>
              and so <m>S</m> spans <m>U_{2 \times 2}</m>.
              Thus, <m>S</m> is a basis for
              <m>U_{2 \times 2}</m> and so <m>\dim(U_{2 \times 2}) = 3</m>.
              Similarly, for the <m>3 \times 3</m> case let <m>M_{ij}</m> for <m>i \leq j</m> be the
              <m>3 \times 3</m> matrix with a 1 in the <m>ij</m> position and 0 in every other position.
              Let
              <me>
                S = \{M_{11}, M_{12}, M_{13}, M_{22}, M_{23}, M_{33}\}
              </me>.
              Equating corresponding entries shows that if
              <me>
                x_1M_{11} +  x_2M_{12} + x_3M_{13} + x_4 M_{22}+ x_5 M_{23} + x_6M_{33} = 0
              </me>,
              then <m>x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = x_4 = x_5 = x_6 = 0</m>.
              So <m>S</m> is a linearly independent set.
              If <m>A = [a_{ij}]</m> is in <m>U_{3 \times 3}</m>,
              then <m>A = \sum_{i \geq j} a_{ij}M_{ij}</m> and <m>S</m> spans <m>U_{3 \times 3}</m>.
              We conclude that <m>S</m> is a basis for
              <m>U_{3 \times 3}</m> and <m>\dim(U_{3 \times 3}) = 6</m>.
              In general, for an <m>n \times n</m> matrix,
              the set of matrices <m>M_{ij}</m>,
              one for each entry on and above the diagonal,
              is a basis for <m>U_{n \times n}</m>.
              There are <m>n</m> such matrices for the entries on the diagonal.
              The number of entries above the diagonal is equal to half the total number of entries (<m>n^2</m>) minus half the number of entries on the diagonal
              (<m>n</m>).
              So there is a total of <m>\frac{n^2-n}{2}</m> such matrices for the entries above the diagonal.
              Therefore,
              <me>
                \dim(U_{n \times n}) = n+\frac{n^2-n}{2} = \frac{n^2+n}{2}
              </me>.
