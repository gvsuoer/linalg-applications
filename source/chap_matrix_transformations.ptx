        <li>
          <p>
            What properties do matrix transformations have? (In particular,
            what properties make matrix transformations <em>linear</em>?)

            What is the domain of a matrix transformation defined by an <m>m \times n</m> matrix?
            Why?

            What are the range and codomain of a matrix transformation defined by an 
            <m>m \times n</m> matrix?
            Why?

        <li>
          <p>
            What does it mean for a matrix transformation to be one-to-one?
            If <m>T</m> is a matrix transformation represented as <m>T(\vx) = A \vx</m>,
            what are the conditions on <m>A</m> that make <m>T</m> a one-to-one transformation?

        <li>
          <p>
            What does it mean for a matrix transformation to be onto?
            If <m>T</m> is a matrix transformation represented as <m>T(\vx) = A \vx</m>,
            what are the conditions on <m>A</m> that make <m>T</m> an onto transformation?
