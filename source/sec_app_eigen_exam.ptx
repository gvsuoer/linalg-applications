    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} 1\amp 2\amp 3\\4\amp 5\amp 6\\7\amp 8\amp 9 \end{array} \right]</m>.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Approximate the dominant eigenvalue of <m>A</m> accurate to two decimal places using the power method.

              Find the characteristic polynomial <m>p(\lambda)</m> of <m>A</m>.
              Then find the the root of <m>p(\lambda)</m> farthest from the origin.
              Compare to the result of part (a).
              Use technology as appropriate.

        <em>Example Solution. </em>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              We use technology to calculate the scaled vectors
              <m>A^k \vx_0</m> for values of <m>k</m> until the components don't change in the second decimal place.
              We start with the seed <m>\vx_0 = [1 \ 1 \ 1]^{\tr}</m>.
              For example, to two decimal places we have
              <m>\vx_k = [0.28 \ 0.64 \ 1.00]^{\tr}</m> for <m>k  \geq 20</m>.
              So we suspect that <m>\left[ 0.28 \ 0.64 \ 1.00 \right]^{\tr}</m> is close to a dominant eigenvector for <m>A</m>.
              For the dominant eigenvalue,
              we can calculate the Rayleigh quotients
              <m>\frac{(A\vx_k) \cdot \vx_k}{\vx_k \cdot \vx_k}</m> until they do not change to two decimal places.
              For <m>k \geq 4</m>, our Rayleigh quotients are all
              (to two decimal places)
              equal to <m>16.12</m>.
              So we expect that the dominant eigenvalue of <m>A</m> is close to <m>16.12</m>.
              Notice that
              <me>
                A [0.28 \ 0.64 \ 1.00]^{\tr} =  [4.56 \ 10.32 \ 16.08]^{\tr}
              </me>,
              which is not far off from <m>16.12 [0.28 \ 0.64 \ 1.00]^{\tr}</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The characteristic polynomial of <m>A</m> is
              <me>
                p(\lambda) =-\lambda^3 + 15 \lambda^2 + 18 \lambda = -\lambda(\lambda^2-15\lambda-18)
              </me>.
              The quadratic formula gives the nonzero roots of <m>p(\lambda)</m> as
              <me>
                \frac{15 \pm \sqrt{15^2 + 4(18)}}{2} = \frac{15 \pm 3\sqrt{33}}{2}
              </me>.
              The roots farthest from the origin is approximately <m>16.12</m>,
              as was also calculated in part (a).

        Let <m>A = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} 2\amp 1\amp 0 \\ 1\amp 3\amp 1 \\ 0\amp 1\amp 2 \end{array} \right]</m>.

              Use the power method to approximate the dominant eigenvalue and a corresponding eigenvector
              (using scaling)
              accurate to two decimal places.
              Use <m>\vx_0 = [1 \ 1 \ 1]^{\tr}</m> as the seed.

              Determine the exact value of the dominant eigenvalue of <m>A</m> and compare to your result from part (a).

          <li>
            <p>
              Approximate the remaining eigenvalues of <m>A</m> using the inverse power method.
              <hint>
                <p>
                  Try <m>\alpha = 0.5</m> and <m>\alpha = 1.8</m>.

        <em>Example Solution. </em>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              We use technology to calculate the scaled vectors
              <m>A^k \vx_0</m> for values of <m>k</m> until the components don't change in the second decimal place.
              For example,
              to two decimal places we have <m>\vx_k = [0.50 \ 1.00 \ 0.50]^{\tr}</m> for <m>k \geq 4</m>.
              So we suspect that <m>\left[ \frac{1}{2} \ 1 \ \frac{1}{2} \right]^{\tr}</m> is a dominant eigenvector for <m>A</m>.
              For the dominant eigenvalue,
              we can calculate the Rayleigh quotients
              <m>\frac{(A\vx_k) \cdot \vx_k}{\vx_k \cdot \vx_k}</m> until they do not change to two decimal places.
              For <m>k \geq 2</m>, our Rayleigh quotients are all
              (to two decimal places)
              equal to <m>4</m>.
              So we expect that the dominant eigenvalue of <m>A</m> is <m>4</m>.
              We could also use the fact that
              <me>
                A \left[ \frac{1}{2} \ 1 \ \frac{1}{2} \right]^{\tr} = [2 \ 4 \ 2]^{\tr} = 4\left[ \frac{1}{2} \ 1 \ \frac{1}{2} \right]^{\tr}
              </me>
              to see that <m>\left[ \frac{1}{2} \ 1 \ \frac{1}{2} \right]^{\tr}</m> is a dominant eigenvector for <m>A</m> with eigenvalue <m>4</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Technology shows that the characteristic polynomial of <m>A - \lambda I_3</m> is
              <me>
                p(\lambda) = -\lambda^3 + 7\lambda^2 - 14 \lambda + 8 = -(\lambda-1)(\lambda-2)(\lambda-4)
              </me>.
              We can see from the characteristic polynomial that <m>4</m> is the dominant eigenvalue of <m>A</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Applying the power method to <m>B = (A-0.5I_3)^{-1}</m> with seed
              <m>\vx_0 = [1 \ 1 \ 1]^{\tr}</m> gives <m>\vx_k \approx [ 0.50 \ 1.00 \ 0.50]^{\tr}</m> for <m>k \geq 5</m>,
              with Rayleigh quotients of <m>2</m>
              (to several decimal places).
              So <m>2</m> is the dominant eigenvalue of <m>B</m>.
              But <m>\frac{1}{\lambda-0.5}</m> is also the dominant eigenvalue of <m>B</m>,
              where <m>\lambda</m> is the corresponding eigenvalue of <m>A</m>. . So to find <m>\lambda</m>,
              we note that <m>\frac{1}{\lambda-0.5} = 2</m> implies that
              <m>\lambda = 1</m> is an eigenvalue of <m>A</m>.
              Now applying the power method to
              <m>B = (A-1.8I_3)^{-1}</m> with seed <m>\vx_0 = [1 \ 1 \ 1]^{\tr}</m> gives
              <m>\vx_k \approx [ 1.00 \ -1.00 \ 1.00]^{\tr}</m> for large enough <m>k</m>,
              with Rayleigh quotients of <m>5</m>
              (to several decimal places).
              To find the corresponding eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m> for <m>A</m>,
              we note that <m>\frac{1}{\lambda-1.8} = 5</m>,
              or <m>\lambda = 2</m> is an eigenvalue of <m>A</m>.
              Admittedly, this method is very limited.
              Finding good choices for <m>\alpha</m> often depends on having some information about the eigenvalues of <m>A</m>.
              Choosing <m>\alpha</m> close to an eigenvalue provides the best chance of obtaining that eigenvalue.
