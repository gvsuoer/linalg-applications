  <title>Eigenspaces, A Geometric Example</title>
  <p>
    Recall that for each eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m> of an <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m>,
    the eigenspace of <m>A</m> corresponding to the eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m> is <m>\Nul (A - \lambda I_n)</m>.
    These eigenspaces can tell us important information about the matrix transformation defined by <m>A</m>.
    For example,
    consider the matrix transformation <m>T</m> from <m>\R^3</m> to <m>\R^3</m> defined by <m>T(\vx) = A \vx</m>, where
    <me>
      A = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} 1\amp 0\amp 1\\0\amp 1\amp 1\\0\amp 0\amp 2 \end{array}  \right]
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are interested in understanding what this matrix transformation does to vectors in <m>\R^3</m>.
    First we note that <m>A</m> has eigenvalues
    <m>\lambda_1 = 1</m> and <m>\lambda_2 = 2</m>,
    with <m>\lambda_1</m> having multiplicity <m>2</m>.
    There is a pair <m>\vv_1 = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1\\0\\0 \end{array}  \right]</m> and
    <m>\vv_2 = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 0\\1\\0 \end{array}  \right]</m> of linearly independent eigenvectors for <m>A</m> corresponding to the eigenvalue <m>\lambda_1</m> and an eigenvector
    <m>\vv_3=\left[ \begin{array}{c} 1\\1\\1 \end{array}  \right]</m> for <m>A</m> corresponding to the eigenvalue <m>\lambda_2</m>.
    Note that the vectors <m>\vv_1</m>,
    <m>\vv_2</m>, and <m>\vv_3</m> are linearly independent
    (recall from Theorem that eigenvectors corresponding to different eigenvalues are always linearly independent).
    So any vector <m>\vb</m> in <m>\R^3</m> can be written uniquely as a linear combination of <m>\vv_1</m>,
    <m>\vv_2</m>, and <m>\vv_3</m>.
    Let's now consider the action of the matrix transformation <m>T</m> on a linear combination of <m>\vv_1</m>,
    <m>\vv_2</m>, and <m>\vv_2</m>.
    Note that
    <md>
      <mrow>T(c_1\vv_1 + c_2 \vv_2 + c_3 \vv_3) \amp = c_1T(\vv_1) + c_2T(\vv_2) + c_3 T(\vv_3)</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp = c_1 \lambda_1 \vv_1 + c_2 \lambda_1 \vv_2 + c_3 \lambda_2 \vv_3</mrow>
      <mrow xml:id="eq_4_b_2" number="yes">\amp = (1)(c_1\vv_1 + c_2 \vv_2) + (2)c_3 \vv_3</mrow>
    </md>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Equation <xref ref="eq_4_b_2"/> illustrates that it is most convenient to view the action of <m>T</m> in the coordinate system where
    <m>\Span \{\vv_1\}</m> serves as the <m>x</m>-axis,
    <m>\Span \{\vv_2\}</m> serves as the <m>y</m>-axis,
    and <m>\Span \{\vv_3\}</m> as the <m>z</m>-axis.
    In this case,
    we can visualize that when we apply the transformation <m>T</m> to a vector
    <m>\vb = c_1 \vv_1 + c_2 \vv_2 + c_3 \vv_3</m> in <m>\R^3</m> the result is an output vector that is unchanged in the <m>\vv_1</m>-<m>\vv_2</m> plane and scaled by a factor of <m>2</m> in the <m>\vv_3</m> direction.
    For example,
    consider the box whose sides are determined by the vectors <m>\vv_1</m>,
    <m>\vv_2</m>,
    and <m>\vv_3</m> as shown in <xref ref="F_4_b_1"></xref>.
    The transformation <m>T</m> stretches this box by a factor of <m>2</m> in the <m>\vv_3</m> direction and leaves everything else alone,
    as illustrated in <xref ref="F_4_b_1"></xref>.
    So the entire <m>\Span \{\vv_1, \vv_2\})</m> is unchanged by <m>T</m>,
    but <m>\Span \{\vv_3\})</m> is scaled by <m>2</m>.
    In this situation,
    the eigenvalues and eigenvectors provide the most convenient perspective through which to visualize the action of the transformation <m>T</m>.

  <p>
    This geometric perspective illustrates how each eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenspace of <m>A</m> tells us something important about <m>A</m>.
    So it behooves us to learn a little more about eigenspaces.
