    In the previous sections,
    we identified operations on a given linear system with corresponding equivalent operations on 
    the matrix representations which simplify the system and its matrix representation without 
    changing the solutions of the system.
    Our end goal was to obtain a system which could be solved using back substitution, such as
    <md alignment="alignat">
      <mrow> {}x_1   \amp {}-{}   \amp {}x_2   \amp {}+{}   \amp {}x_3 \amp {}={}  \amp 0\amp {}</mrow>
      <mrow>{}      \amp {}     \amp {6}x_2 \amp {}-{}  \amp {}x_3 \amp {}={}   \amp 8\amp {}</mrow>
      <mrow>{}      \amp {}    \amp {}    \amp {}     \amp {}x_3 \amp {}={}   \amp 1\amp {.}</mrow>
    </md>
  </p>
  <p>
    The augmented matrix for this system is
    <me>
      \left[ \begin{array}{crr|c} 1 \amp -1 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\ 0\amp  6 \amp -1 \amp 8 \\ 0\amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 1 \end{array}  \right]
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The matrices of linear systems which can be solved via back substitution are said to be in
    <term>row echelon form</term>
    (or simply <term>echelon form</term>).
    We will define the properties of matrices in this form precisely in this section.
    Our goal will be to prescribe a precise procedure for converting any matrix to an equivalent one 
    in row echelon form without having to convert back to the system representation.

      We want to determine a suitable form for an augmented matrix that can be obtained from row 
      operations so that it is straightforward to find the solutions to the system.
      We begin with some examples.

          Write the linear system corresponding to each of the following augmented matrices.
          Use the linear system to determine which systems have their variables eliminated completely 
          in the forward direction,
          or equivalently determine for which systems the next step in the solution process is back 
          substitution
          (possibly using free variables).
          Explain your reasoning.
          You do not need to solve the systems.

          which is easier to solve and why?
