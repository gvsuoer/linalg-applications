    In this section we will investigate how a basis in <m>\R^n</m> provides a coordinate system in which each vector in <m>\R^n</m> has a unique set of coordinates.
    In this way,
    each basis will provide us with a new perspective to visualize <m>\R^n</m>.
    Then we will see how coordinate vectors can allow us to find change of basis matrices that we can use to easily switch between coordinate systems.
    We begin our analysis of coordinate systems by looking at how a basis in <m>\R^2</m> gives us a different view of <m>\R^2</m>.

          Draw the vector <m>\vb = -3\vv_1 + 2\vv_2</m> in <xref ref="F_PA_5d_1"></xref>.

          In part (2) we were given the weights (<m>-3</m> and 2) of the linear combination of <m>\vv_1</m> and <m>\vv_2</m> that produced <m>\vb</m>.
          We call the vector <m>\left[ \begin{array}{r} -3 \\2 \end{array} \right]</m> the
          <term>coordinate vector</term>
          of <m>\vb</m> with respect to the basis <m>\{\vv_1, \vv_2\}</m>.
          Explain why any vector <m>\vb</m> in <m>\R^2</m> can be written as a linear combination of vectors <m>\vv_1, \vv_2</m>.
          This shows that each vector in <m>\R^2</m> has a coordinate vector in the coordinate system defined by <m>\vv_1</m> and <m>\vv_2</m>.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Since <m>\{\vv_1, \vv_2\}</m> is a basis for <m>\R^2</m>,
          any vector <m>\vb</m> in <m>\R^2</m> has a coordinate vector in the coordinate system defined by <m>\vv_1</m> and <m>\vv_2</m>.
          But we also need to make sure that each vector has a unique coordinate vector.
          Explain why there is no vector in <m>\R^2</m> which has two different coordinate vectors.

      <introduction>
        <p>
          We can think of the vectors <m>\vv_1</m> and <m>\vv_2</m> as defining a coordinate system,
          with <m>\Span\{\vv_1\}</m> as the
          <q><m>x</m></q>
          -axis and <m>\Span\{\vv_2\}</m> as the
          <q><m>y</m></q>
          -axis.
          Any vector <m>\vb</m> in <m>\R^2</m> can be written uniquely in the form
          <me>
            \vb = x_1 \vv_1 + x_2 \vv_2
          </me>
          and the weights serve as the coordinates of <m>\vb</m> in the <m>\vv_1</m>,
          <m>\vv_2</m> coordinate system.
          In this case the coordinate vector
          <m>\left[ \begin{array}{c} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{array}  \right]</m> of <m>\vb</m> with respect to the basis
          <m>\CB = \{\vv_1, \vv_2\}</m> is written as <m>[\vb]_{\CB}</m>.
          Let <m>\CB = \left\{ \left[ \begin{array}{r} -1 \\ 4 \end{array}  \right], \left[ \begin{array}{c} 2 \\ 0 \end{array}  \right]\right\}</m>.

                Show that <m>\CB</m> is a basis for <m>\R^2</m>.

                Find <m>[\vb]_{\CB}</m> if <m>\vb = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 6 \end{array} \right]</m>.
                Draw a picture to illustrate how <m>\vb</m> is expressed as a linear combination of the vectors in <m>\CB</m>.
