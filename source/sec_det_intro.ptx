    We know that a non-zero vector <m>\vx</m> is an eigenvector of an <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> if
    <m>A \vx = \lambda \vx</m> for some scalar <m>\lambda</m>.
    Note that this equation can be written as <m>(A-\lambda I_n)\vx=\vzero</m>.
    Until now, we were given eigenvalues of matrices and have used the eigenvalues to find the eigenvectors.
    In this section we will learn an algebraic technique to find the eigenvalues ourselves.
    We will also be able to justify why an
    <m>n\times n</m> matrix has at most <m>n</m> eigenvalues.
  </p>
  <p>
    A scalar <m>\lambda</m> is an eigenvalue of <m>A</m> if
    <m>(A - \lambda I_n)\vx=\vzero</m> has a non-trivial solution <m>\vx</m>,
    which happens if and only if <m>A-\lambda I_n</m> is not invertible.
    In this section we will find a scalar whose value will tell us when a matrix is invertible and when it is not,
    and use this scalar to find the eigenvalues of a matrix.

      In this activity, we will focus on <m>2\times 2</m> matrices.
      Let <m>A = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} a\amp b \\ c\amp d \end{array}  \right]</m> be a <m>2\times 2</m> matrix.
      To see if <m>A</m> is invertible,
      we row reduce <m>A</m> by replacing row 2 with <m>a\cdot</m>(row 2) <m>- c \cdot</m>(row 1):
      <me>
        \left[ \begin{array}{cc} a\amp b \\ 0\amp ad-bc \end{array}  \right]
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the only way <m>A</m> can be reduced <m>I_2</m> is if <m>ad - bc \neq 0</m>.
      We call this quantity <m>ad-bc</m> the
      <em>determinant</em> of <m>A</m>,
      and denote the determinant of <m>A</m> as <m>\det(A)</m> or <m>|A|</m>.
      When <m>\det(A)\neq 0</m>, we know that
      <me>
        A^{-1} = \frac{1}{ad-bc} \left[ \begin{array}{rr} d\amp -b \\ -c\amp a \end{array}  \right]
      </me>.
    </p>

      We now consider how we can use the determinant to find eigenvalues and other information about the invertibility of a matrix.

            Let <m>A = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 1\amp 2 \\ 2\amp 4 \end{array} \right]</m>.
            Find <m>\det(A)</m> by hand.
            What does this mean about the matrix <m>A</m>?
            Can you confirm this with other methods?

            One of the eigenvalues of <m>A=\left[ \begin{array}{cc} 1\amp 3 \\ 2\amp 2 \end{array} \right]</m> is <m>\lambda=4</m>.
            Recall that we can rewrite the matrix equation
            <m>A\vx=4\vx</m> in the form <m>(A-4I_2) \vx = \vzero</m>.
            What must be true about <m>A-4I_2</m> in order for 4 to be an eigenvalue of <m>A</m>?
            How does this relate to <m>\det(A-4I_2)</m>?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Another eigenvalue of <m>A=\left[ \begin{array}{cc} 1\amp 3 \\ 2\amp 2 \end{array} \right]</m> is <m>\lambda=-1</m>.
            What must be true about <m>A+I_2</m> in order for <m>-1</m> to be an eigenvalue of <m>A</m>?
            How does this relate to <m>\det(A+I_2)</m>?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            To find the eigenvalues of the matrix <m>A=\left[ \begin{array}{cc} 3\amp 2\\2\amp 6 \end{array} \right]</m>,
            we rewrite the equation <m>A \vx = \lambda \vx</m> as <m>(A - \lambda I_2) \vx = \vzero</m>.
            The coefficient matrix of this last system has the form <m>A-\lambda I_2 = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 3-\lambda \amp 2 \\ 2\amp 6-\lambda \end{array} \right]</m>.
            The determinant of this matrix is a quadratic expression in <m>\lambda</m>.
            Since the eigenvalues will occur when the determinant is 0, we need to solve a quadratic equation.
            Find the resulting eigenvalues.
            (Note: One of the eigenvalues is 2.)

            Can you explain why a <m>2\times 2</m> matrix can have at most two eigenvalues?
