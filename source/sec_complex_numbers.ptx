  <title>Complex Numbers</title>
  <p>
    Complex numbers are usually introduced as a tool to solve the quadratic equation <m>x^2+1 = 0</m>.
    However, that is not how complex numbers first came to light.
    The story actually involves solutions to the general cubic equation.
    The interested reader could consult Chapter 6 of William Dunham's excellent book
    <em>Journey Through Genius</em>.
    In this appendix we touch on the basics of complex numbers to provide enough context for the section on complex eigenvalues.

  <p>
    A complex number is defined by a pair of real numbers - the <em>real part</em>
    of the complex number and the <em>imaginary part</em> of the complex number.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>complex number</term>
            <idx><h>complex number</h></idx>
        is a number of the form
        <me>
          a+bi
        </me>
        where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are real numbers and <m>i^2 = -1</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    The number <m>a</m> is the real part<idx><h>complex number</h><h>real part</h></idx> of the complex number and the number <m>b</m> is the imaginary part.
        <idx><h>complex number</h><h>imaginary part</h></idx>
    We often write
    <me>
      z = a+bi
    </me>
    for a complex number <m>z</m>,
    <m>\text{ Re } (z)</m> for the real part of <m>z</m> and
    <m>\text{ Im } (z)</m> for the imaginary part of <m>z</m>.
    That is, if <m>z = a+bi</m> with <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> real numbers,
    then <m>\text{ Re } (z) = a</m> and <m>\text{ Im } (z) = b</m>.
    We say that two complex numbers <m>a+bi</m> and <m>c+di</m> are equal if <m>a=c</m> and <m>b=d</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is an arithmetic of complex numbers that is determined by an addition and multiplication of complex numbers.
    Adding complex numbers is natural:
    <me>
      (a+bi) + (c+di) = (a+c) + (b+d)i
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    That is, to add two complex numbers we add their real parts together and their imaginary parts together.
  </p>

    <p>
      Multiplication of complex numbers is is also done in a natural way.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            By expanding the product as usual,
            treating <m>i</m> as we would any real number,
            and exploiting the fact that <m>i^2 = -1</m>,
            explain why we define the product of complex numbers <m>a+bi</m> and <m>c+di</m> as
            <me>
              (a+bi)(c+di) = (ac-bd) + (bc+ad)i
            </me>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Use the definitions of addition and multiplication to write each of the sums or products as a complex number in the form <m>a+bi</m>.
            <ol label="i">
              <li>
                <p>
                  <m>(2+3i) + (7-4i)</m>
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <m>(4-2i)(3+i)</m>
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <m>(2+i)i - (3+4i)</m>
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>

    It isn't difficult to show that the set of complex numbers,
    which we denote by <m>\C</m>,
    satisfies many useful and familiar properties.

      Show that <m>\C</m> has the same structure as <m>\R</m>.
      That is, show that for all <m>u</m>, <m>w</m>,
      and <m>z</m> in <m>\C</m>, the following properties are satisfied.

    The result of <xref ref="act_complex_field">Activity</xref> is that,
    just like <m>\R</m>, the set <m>\C</m> is a field.
    If we wanted to,
    we could define vector spaces over <m>\C</m> just like we did over <m>\R</m>.
    The same results hold.
